When you're trying to get pregnant, it's always a good idea to eat a well-balanced diet that includes a wide variety of healthy foods. If you're curious about the benefits of omega-3s, taking omega-3s – or eating a diet rich in fatty fish with high amounts of omega-3s – can in fact up your fertility odds.
And another plus? Once you're pregnant, these nutrients are important for your growing baby's brain and eye development. 
What is an omega-3 supplement?
 
An omega-3 supplement is one that contains omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential types of fats that the body needs but can't produce on its own. This means that omega-3s have to come from food or a supplement which is available in liquid form or as soft chews or a gel.
Fatty cold-water fish, such as salmon and sardines, contain the highest amounts of omega-3s, making fish the ideal food source. But whether you eat fish or plan to take a supplement, read labels carefully and look for two of the most important fatty acids, eicosatetraenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
 
What are the benefits of taking a fish oil supplement?
 
Taking fish oil supplements has numerous benefits for women who are pregnant and for those who are trying to conceive. In fact, consuming a healthy diet pre-pregnancy, especially one that's high in folic acid, vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids, has been linked to higher rates of fertility – and research bears this out.
One study of women ages 30 to 44 who were trying to get pregnant naturally noted that those who took omega-3 supplements had better chances of conception than those who didn't take omega-3s.
 
Omega-3s have been found to aid fertility by reducing inflammation, boosting ovulation and hormone production, and positively affecting the growth of oocytes, or immature eggs, in the ovaries.
 
And once pregnancy is underway, the benefits of taking a fish oil supplement continue. A review of studies looked at whether taking omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) could improve the health of babies-on-board as well as their mothers – and the results were very encouraging. The rate of preterm birth and very preterm birth was lower in those who took omega-3 LCPUFAs. There were also fewer babies with low birthweight in moms who took omega-3s.
 
Will taking omega-3s help my fertility?
 
Not only will taking omega-3s help with fertility, it's strongly suggested for every person who's trying to conceive or is already pregnant. Indeed, the science is that strong – and it's super easy to take a supplement or eat the foods that are high in EPA and DHA (there's also a plant-based form of omega-3 called alpha-linoleic or ALA).

If you're trying to conceive, keep in mind that your body will store omega-3s for several weeks, so getting enough regularly will ensure that you have adequate levels when you become pregnant. In general, it's better if you can get your omegas from food – that way you'll benefit from other nutrients in the food at the same time.
But if you're worried about mercury in seafood, know that supplements are mercury-free and there are lots of healthy fish choices you can enjoy that are low in mercury.
 
Other sources of omega-3s
 
Beyond omega-3 supplements made from fish oil, you can also consider those derived from algae. These supplements are great for vegetarians, plus they have no fishy aftertaste. Just be sure that any omega-3 supplement brand you choose filters the oil to eliminate toxins, such as PCBs. See our article on buying supplements for guidance as you shop.
 
And when it comes to food sources for omega-3s, stick to the advice from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) which is also backed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These organizations recommend that women eat two to three servings per week (8 to 12 ounces total) of a variety of low-mercury seafood, such as haddock, hake, salmon, cod, sole, skate and shrimp.
And be certain to avoid those fish species that are known to be high in mercury, like king mackerel, marlin, swordfish, tilefish, shark and orange roughy."

There isn't any conclusive evidence that specific foods can make you more fertile. But research has found that a well-balanced diet full of good-for-you foods can support your overall health and therefore possibly help you get pregnant.
 
That's in part because your general lifestyle does matter when trying to get pregnant. You can optimize your body for conception by maintaining a healthy weight, eating healthy foods, and minimizing the junky stuff such as saturated fats, simple sugars, and processed foods. Practicing smart eating habits now can help you have a healthy pregnancy once you conceive, too.
 
 
Here are some suggestions for how and what to eat in order to set the stage for a healthy pregnancy and baby.
 
Foods that may support fertility
 Fruits and vegetables
 
Think of produce as Mother Nature's multivitamin. Fruits and vegetables deliver a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, and getting enough of certain nutrients is especially important before you conceive.
 
For example, foods like spinach, brussels sprouts, asparagus, broccoli, citrus fruits, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and fortified breads and cereals are high in the B vitamin folate. Folate is a natural form of folic acid, an essential nutrient in prenatal vitamins, which you should take if you're trying to conceive.
 
 
Eating foods rich in folate during preconception and pregnancy can help prevent neural-tube birth defects such as spina bifida. You can lose a lot of this vitamin in cooking water, so steam or cook vegetables in a small amount of water to preserve the folate.
 
In general, choose fruits and vegetables in a range of colors to get the most nutritional bang for your buck. (Eating a produce ""rainbow"" gives you a wider variety of nutrients.)
 Fish

Seafood is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids; and, according to some scientists, these essential fats may have a positive effect on fertility. Research suggests that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids is associated with an increased probability of conceiving naturally (without assisted reproductive technologies), and therefore it's safe and even encouraged that you eat fish when you're trying to conceive.
 
On the other hand, you've probably also heard that some types of fish contain contaminants such as mercury. In high doses, heavy metals like this are harmful to a baby's developing brain and nervous system. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises limiting some fish, including white (albacore) tuna, and completely avoiding swordfish, marlin, orange roughy, tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, king mackerel, bigeye tuna, and shark, because these have the highest mercury levels.
 
The good news is that not all fish contain a lot of mercury. The FDA also says that women trying to conceive can safely eat up to 12 ounces (roughly two or three servings) a week of fish, including canned light tuna, salmon, shrimp, cod, tilapia, and catfish.
 
You can take fish oil supplements if you don't like seafood, but talk to your provider first about which brand to buy and how much to take.
 Oysters
 
There's some scientific proof that eating oysters can boost fertility. Oysters are packed with zinc, which plays a role in semen and testosterone production in men and ovulation and fertility in women. These mollusks are also notorious for being an aphrodisiac.
 
Still, that doesn't mean you have to down a plate of oysters on the half shell at every meal. Maintaining the recommended dietary allowance of zinc (8 mg a day for women and 11 mg for men) can help keep your reproductive system working properly, but excessive amounts of zinc (or any nutrient, for that matter) will not turn either you or your partner into a baby-making machine. And, an excess of zinc in your body can interfere with your body's ability to absorb copper, which can adversely affect the immune system.
 Vegetable proteins
 
Protein is a critical part of a healthy diet, but according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA), many Americans rely too heavily on beef, pork, and chicken to get their daily amount. In a study of 18,555 women, experts at Harvard Medical School found that those who included one daily serving of vegetable protein – such as nuts, beans, peas, soybeans, or tofu – were less likely to have infertility due to ovulation problems. Research also shows that replacing meat proteins with vegetable proteins can reduce the risk of infertility as well.
 
More research is needed on the link to fertility, but because vegetable proteins are usually lower in fat and calories than steak or chicken, including them in your meal plans is both good for you and a great way to maintain a healthy weight.
 Whole grains
 
Eating as many nutrient-rich foods as possible while trying to conceive is recommended, and whole grains are a great option. According to studies, healthy diets that include whole grains are associated with better fertility. In fact, one study found that women who introduced whole grains into their diets before undergoing fertility treatment such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) had a higher probability of implantation and live birth.
 
The USDA food guidelines recommend that you make at least half of the grains you eat each day whole grains such as bran cereal, oatmeal, brown rice, or whole-wheat bread.
 Full-fat dairy products
 
Interestingly, studies have found that full-fat dairy products such as yogurt, whole milk, and cheese increase your chances of getting pregnant, while low-fat dairy products like skim milk have the opposite effect on fertility.
 
Foods to avoid while trying to conceive
 
Steer clear of fad diets while trying to get pregnant, as some of these diets can deplete your body of essential nutrients. Also try to minimize your consumption of:
 Alcohol
 
Research finds that abstaining from alcohol completely while trying to conceive isn't totally necessary. But binge-drinking, which the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines as consuming 4 or more drinks for women or 5 or more drinks for men in just a few hours, will likely affect your chances of getting pregnant.
 
Alcohol can harm a developing fetus, and since you may not know exactly when you ovulate or conceive, you may want to play it safe and cut out alcohol completely. It's a good excuse to enjoy some delicious and classic ""virgin"" drinks!
 Trans fats
 
Consuming high amounts of trans fats, found in many processed, fried and fast foods, is linked to infertility in women and to lower sperm counts and less than ideal sperm formation and lower sperm counts in men. Trans fats may also have a negative impact on the duration of pregnancy, resulting in preterm labor and birth.
 Refined carbohydrates
 
Studies have found that eating higher amounts of refined carbohydrates like white bread, pasta, and white rice can lower your likelihood of getting pregnant. These foods also generally shortchange your body, because the refining process strips grains of key nutrients such as fiber, some B vitamins, and iron.
 
If you have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause of infertility in women, pay extra attention to the types of carbs you eat. PCOS is a hormonal imbalance that can get worse when insulin levels in the bloodstream surge, and refined carbohydrates are a main cause of insulin spikes.
 Caffeine
 
There's some evidence that very high caffeine consumption – more than 500 milligrams a day, or about five 8-ounce cups of coffee, depending on the strength of the brew – might interfere with fertility. But experts generally agree that low to moderate caffeine consumption (less than 200 milligrams a day, or about two 8-ounce cups of coffee) likely won't make it harder for you to get pregnant.
 
Because no one knows for sure the direct correlation between caffeine and fertility, some experts suggest lowering your caffeine intake even more or giving it up entirely, especially if you're having difficulty conceiving or if you're undergoing in vitro fertilization.
 
Is it important to avoid certain foods if I'm taking letrozole for fertility?
 
Generally speaking, you don't need to avoid any foods while taking letrozole. Letrozole is most often used as a breast cancer drug, but it can be prescribed off-label for women trying to get pregnant. Letrozole for infertility is typically given during the follicular phase of your menstrual cycle; it blocks estrogen production and tells your brain to produce follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which causes one ovary or both ovaries to release one or multiple eggs, also known as ovulation.
 
However, letrozole for fertility could lead to side effects such as hot flashes and night sweats, so you may want to avoid spicy foods to minimize the discomfort.
 
Does my male partner need to change their diet if we're trying to conceive?
 
When it comes to fertility and diet, men don't get a free pass. It's a good idea for your male partner to pay attention to his diet since certain vitamins and nutrients – such as zinc and vitamins C and E, omega-3 fatty acids, and folic acid – are as important for making healthy sperm as they are in making healthy eggs. About 40 to 50 percent of infertility is due to male factor infertility.
 
In fact, some data shows that sperm count and quality have declined over the last forty years or so, in part due to the influx of men with unhealthy lifestyles, high-fat diets, and obesity. On the contrary, studies have found that men who ate fish, fruits, vegetables, and legumes like walnuts that are high in selenium and zinc were more fertile than those who didn't. Research has also concluded that it's a good idea for men who are trying for a pregnancy to limit their intake of trans fats, processed meats, and large amounts of soy to maximize their fertility potential.
 
Other ways to support fertility
 
Trying to conceive isn't just about eating a good diet; it's also about preparing your body for a healthy pregnancy and baby. Here are the essential steps to take:
 Take a prenatal vitamin with folic acid
 
Even if you have a very balanced diet, it's still important to take prenatal vitamins to reduce the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects (NTD) such as spina bifida. Most experts recommend that all women start taking folic acid at least a month before trying to get pregnant. In fact, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends all women of child-bearing age take a prenatal vitamin with 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily, and then bump this dosage up to 600 mcg once pregnant and throughout the first trimester.
 
If you have a family history of NTD or take medication for seizures, your healthcare provider may suggest that you boost your daily folic acid intake to 4,000 mcg, or 4 mg, starting at least a month before you conceive and continuing throughout your first trimester.
 
Taking a prenatal vitamin ensures that you're getting enough folic acid and other essential nutrients to boost your chances of conceiving a healthy baby. Bonus: There's some evidence that taking a prenatal vitamin before you conceive can help you avoid morning sickness once you're pregnant.
 
A good over-the-counter prenatal vitamin should contain more than the minimum recommendation of folic acid, but if your provider wants you to take more, you may need to take a separate folic acid supplement. Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, so your body will flush out the excess if you consume too much. Be aware that getting too much folate may hide a vitamin B12 deficiency, which is sometimes a problem for vegetarians. Ask your doctor or midwife if you think you may be at risk.
 
Remember that a supplement is a safeguard, not a substitute for a sound diet. And since regular over-the-counter multivitamins may contain megadoses of vitamins and minerals that could be harmful to a developing baby, choose a pill formulated specifically for pregnant women.
 
If you stick to a vegetarian diet, you may also need vitamin D and B12 supplements, which studies say are beneficial for fertility, along with extra protein. Talk with your healthcare provider about the right prenatal supplement for you.
 
You might want to ask your male partner to consider taking a daily multivitamin that contains zinc and selenium for at least three months before conception. It takes about 74 days for sperm to fully develop and benefit from a man's lifestyle changes, including supplementation, so he can try to get a head start.
 Avoid smoking and recreational drugs
 
If you use any recreational drugs or smoke, quit now. Studies have shown that women who smoke have a significantly increased risk of infertility. Although the effects of drugs on fertility are difficult to study because they're illegal, it's been well documented that these substances can harm a developing fetus, put you at higher risk for preterm labor and delivery, and increase your odds of having a baby with a birth defect.
 Maintain a healthy weight
 
Being overweight or underweight can make it harder to get pregnant, so try to maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI) while you're trying to conceive. Keep in mind that obese women have more pregnancy and birth complications, and underweight women are more likely to have a low-birth-weight baby.
 
Eat plenty of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods such as yogurt, cheese, and milk every day. Not getting enough nutrients can affect your menstrual cycle, making it difficult to predict when you ovulate. And you may not ovulate at all if you're significantly underweight or obese.
 
In addition to following a smart eating plan with low-fat, high-fiber foods, get regular exercise. If you're overweight, aim to lose one to two pounds a week, a safe rate of weight loss. Extreme weight loss from crash dieting can deplete your body's nutritional stores, which isn't a good way to start a pregnancy.
 Pump up your iron intake
 
Too little iron at conception not only can affect your baby, it can also put you at risk for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy and after you give birth (especially if you lose a lot of blood during delivery). Anemia causes your red blood cells to fall below normal and saps your energy.
 
So, make sure you're getting enough iron before you get pregnant, about 18 milligrams daily, especially if your periods are heavy, since menstruating depletes your iron. Up your iron intake during pregnancy to about 27 mg per day ,either through supplementation, iron-rich foods, or both, because your total blood volume increases while pregnant and your developing baby uses up your stores of the mineral.
 
If you don't eat much red meat, or if you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take a prenatal vitamin containing extra iron. You'll know if you have an iron deficiency during pregnancy, since most providers will test your iron levels during a routine blood panel at your preconception checkup."

The recommended daily intake of folic acid for all women of childbearing age is at least 400 micrograms (mcg), or 0.4 milligrams (mg). Taking folic acid for at least one month before conception reduces the risk of neural-tube defects, such as spina bifida, by up to 70 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.During pregnancy, the recommended dose jumps to 600 to 800 mcg, or 0.6 to 0.8 mg. Of course, some women's needs are different. If you have a family history of neural-tube defects, you should probably get 4,000 mcg (4 mg) of folic acid a day. Talk to your doctor about how much you need before and after you conceive.
You can buy folic acid supplements at the drugstore or you can just take a prenatal or regular multivitamin. If you do take a multivitamin, make sure it doesn't contain more than the recommended daily allowance of 770 mcg RAE (2,565 IU) of vitamin A unless it's all in the form of beta-carotene. (Getting too much of a certain kind of vitamin A can cause birth defects.) If you're unsure what to take, ask your healthcare provider to recommend a supplement for you.Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, so your body will flush out the excess if you consume too much.

3	how to get pregnant	Caffeine: Does it affect your fertility?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/caffeine-does-it-affect-your-fertility_4489	"Caffeine: Does it affect your fertility?

Does caffeine affect fertility?
It might. Some studies have found a link between caffeine consumption and a woman's ability to conceive, while others have not. Most experts say there just isn't enough evidence to make a definite conclusion about caffeine and fertility.
Although researchers haven't been able to find a clear connection between moderate caffeine intake and fertility problems, it's generally considered safe to consume 200 to 300 milligrams (mg) of caffeine daily while trying to conceive. That's up to two 8-ounce cups of coffee for a weak brew. If you get more than that, it might be a good idea to cut back.
Which foods and beverages contain caffeine?
Coffee is one, of course. The amount of caffeine in a serving of coffee varies widely, depending on the type of bean, how it's roasted, how it's brewed – and, obviously, on the size of the coffee cup. (For example, espresso contains more caffeine per ounce, but it's served in a tiny cup. So a full cup of brewed coffee will actually deliver more caffeine.)
To manage your caffeine intake, you'll need to be aware of other sources, like tea, soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate, and coffee ice cream. Caffeine also shows up in herbal products and over-the-counter drugs, including some headache, cold, and allergy remedies. Read labels carefully.

How can I cut back on caffeine?
If you decide to drink less caffeine, cut back slowly to avoid withdrawal symptoms, such as fatigue and headaches.
You might want to start by switching to a drink that's half regular brew and half decaf. Or reduce the caffeine in homemade hot beverages by watering them down or brewing them for a shorter time. If you love to start your day with a cup of English Breakfast tea, steeping your tea bag for one minute instead of five reduces the caffeine by as much as half.
Once you've acclimated to life with little or no caffeine, you may find steamed milk with a shot of flavored syrup to be a nice coffee substitute – and the calcium will do you good.

4	how to get pregnant	Can soy isoflavones help me get pregnant?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/can-soy-isoflavones-help-me-get-pregnant_10364266	"Can soy isoflavones help me get pregnant?

Unfortunately, there's no clear-cut answer. Some women claim that taking soy isoflavones helped them conceive, but scientists haven't studied it and there's no data to say whether it's effective – or safe.
In fact, some experts caution that ingesting highly concentrated soy products may actually inhibit fertility, especially in women who have a ""normal"" menstrual cycle, meaning under 35 days and regular. In those women, taking soy supplements could throw a functioning cycle out of whack.
The idea is that soy isoflavones – a type of phytoestrogen, or plant-derived estrogen – may work similarly to the fertility drug clomiphene (brand names Clomid and Serophene). Both act on estrogen pathways in the body and can be used to manipulate the menstrual cycle. If you ovulate irregularly or not at all, this could kick-start ovulation. If your fertility problems are due to something else, the remedies won't help.
In theory, here's how it would work. The soy isoflavones block the estrogen receptors in your brain and fool your body into thinking its natural estrogen levels are low. In response, your body starts a cascade of events to boost estrogen production. (As part of this process, a group of eggs matures so that one will be ready for release during ovulation.) After five days, you stop taking the isoflavones. Once their receptor-blocking effect wears off, your body says, ""Oh, we've got lots of estrogen now – time to ovulate"" and releases a hormone that triggers ovulation.
The problem is that not all soy isoflavones necessarily act this way.
""Some soy isoflavones work as an estrogen blocker but others mimic estrogen – meaning the body thinks it is estrogen. This can cause health problems and make a hormone imbalance worse,"" says Jill Blakeway, a licensed acupuncturist and clinical herbalist and co-author of Making Babies: A Proven Three-Month Program for Maximum Fertility. ""Someone with uterine fibroids, for example, may find that her condition gets worse after taking soy isoflavones.""
The drug clomiphene doesn't present this risk because it's specifically designed to act as an estrogen blocker. Soy isoflavones are more varied and unpredictable in their impact.
Furthermore, certain tissues in your body that are sensitive to estrogen, such as the breasts, uterus, and ovaries, may not fare well when exposed to estrogen-like soy isoflavones. There's some evidence that large doses of soy may encourage cancerous cells to grow in these tissues. There's also evidence that eating too much soy can harm the thyroid and lead to hypothyroidism.
Plus, says Blakeway, if you take soy isoflavones in the first half of your cycle to boost estrogen production, but take nothing in the second half to boost progesterone levels, you can end up with a hormone imbalance that hurts fertility. That's because the hormones involved in the menstrual cycle rise and fall in a finely coordinated dance. If you alter one, it can affect the others.
Advertisement  | page continues below
 
Finally, soy isoflavones are sold as dietary supplements, which means they're not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a result, they aren't subject to the same rigorous testing that prescription or over-the-counter medications are.
""There's just no way to tell that what you're taking contains the amount of soy (or other ingredients) you think it does,"" says nutritionist Hillary M. Wright, director of nutrition counseling at the Domar Center for Mind/Body Health at Boston IVF and author of The PCOS Diet Plan: A Natural Approach to Health for Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Clomiphene, in comparison, is regulated by the FDA, has a long track record of safety, and is prescribed in precise amounts.
Soy isoflavones aren't significantly cheaper than clomiphene, so saving money probably isn't a good reason to use them. The supplements typically run about $10 to $20 for one cycle. Clomiphene is covered by most insurance plans, so the cost would usually consist of the co-pay (often in the range of $5 to $20). If you don't have prescription drug coverage, one cycle of the brand-name drug Clomid costs around $60, and one cycle of the generic version (sold as clomiphene citrate or Milophene) costs around $30. Of course, using any form of clomiphene requires a prescription and care from a health professional.
If you still want to try soy isoflavones for fertility, consider the following advice:Women over 35 should seek medical intervention right away rather than spending time exploring an option like soy that may not be effective, says Shari Brasner, an ob-gyn and professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and author of Advice From a Pregnant Obstetrician.Try soy isoflavones only if you ovulate irregularly or not at all. Don't use them if you have any health issues that could be made worse by taking concentrated phytoestrogens, such as uterine fibroids, uterine polyps, endometriosis, fibrocystic breasts, or thyroid disease.If you have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), it's wise to avoid soy isoflavones – even though clomiphene is often prescribed for women with this condition. Phytoestrogens can aggravate PCOS, says acupuncturist Blakeway. Clomiphene is a better bet for women with PCOS, since experts know exactly how the drug works and it has more predictable results.Take a dose of 80 to 200 mg per day on cycle days 3 to 7 or 5 to 9 (just as you would if you were taking clomiphene), advises Blakeway. Use the lowest dose possible, and don't change it during the five-day course. Also, stick to supplements – it's not realistic to try to get the suggested amount through food alone.Talk with your doctor about possible interactions between soy and any medications you're taking, including antibiotics, thyroid medications, and clomiphene.Be aware that you may experience short-term side effects, including headaches, fatigue, breast tenderness, and digestive disturbances. Taking the supplements at bedtime may help minimize the impact of these side effects.Where to go next:Learn about lifestyle changes and other behaviors that can enhance fertility.Get an overview of conventional fertility treatments.Find out more about the most popular fertility drugs for women."

6	how to get pregnant	Pregnancy symptoms: 10 early signs of pregnancy	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/pregnancy-symptoms_1146468	"Pregnancy symptoms: 10 early signs of pregnancy

Pregnancy symptoms are different for every woman, and can even be different from one pregnancy to the next. Symptoms start at different times, too: Some women immediately feel like they're pregnant, while other women may go months with no pregnancy symptoms.
 
That said, there are some first signs and symptoms of pregnancy that are common very early on. They're likely caused by a surge in the pregnancy hormone human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), as well as rises in estrogen and progesterone.
 
Early signs and symptoms of pregnancy
 
Early pregnancy symptoms can be subtle. You may notice your breasts feel different when you put on your bra, you feel more tired than normal, or your usual breakfast is unappealing.
 
If you start to feel some of the early pregnancy symptoms below, you may very well be pregnant. Here are some of the first signs and symptoms of pregnancy.
 
Missed period
 
If you're usually pretty regular and your period is late, this may be the first and most obvious sign that you're pregnant. But if you're not regular or you're not keeping track of your cycle, other symptoms may be your first clues about a possible pregnancy. And some women feel early pregnancy symptoms before they miss a period.
 
Frequent urination
 
Shortly after you become pregnant, hormonal changes prompt a chain of events that raise the rate of blood flow through your kidneys. This causes your bladder to fill more quickly, so you need to pee more often.
 
Frequent urination will continue – or intensify – as your pregnancy progresses. Your blood volume rises dramatically during pregnancy, which leads to extra fluid being processed and ending up in your bladder.
 
Fatigue
 
Feeling tired all of a sudden? No, make that exhausted. No one knows for sure what causes early pregnancy fatigue, but it's possible that rapidly increasing levels of progesterone are to blame. Of course, morning sickness and having to pee constantly during the night can add to your tiredness, too.
 
You should start to feel more energetic once you hit your second trimester, although fatigue usually returns late in pregnancy when you're carrying more weight and some of the common discomforts of pregnancy make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep.

Sore breasts
 
One common early pregnancy symptom is sensitive, swollen breasts caused by rising levels of hormones. The soreness and swelling may feel like an exaggerated version of how your breasts feel before your period. Your discomfort should diminish significantly after the first trimester, as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes.
 
Nausea
 Morning sickness can start as early as two weeks after conception – so it may be the first pregnancy symptom you notice. And it's not just in the morning, either: Pregnancy-related nausea (with or without vomiting) can be a problem morning, noon, or night.
 
Pregnancy nausea may be accompanied by indigestion, food aversions, a heightened sense of smell, a metallic taste in your mouth, and excess saliva.
 
Implantation bleeding or spotting
 
If you're pregnant, the last thing you'd expect to see is any spotting or vaginal bleeding. But if you notice light spotting around the time your period is due, it could be implantation bleeding. This might be caused by the fertilized egg settling into the lining of your uterus.
 
Note: About 1 in 4 women experience spotting or light bleeding during the first trimester. It's often nothing, but sometimes it's a sign of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. If your bleeding is severe or accompanied by pain or lightheadedness, or if you're at all concerned, call your doctor or midwife.
 
Cramping
 
Like spotting or bleeding, cramping is a confusing early pregnancy symptom – because it can make you feel like your period's starting. But you may actually be having implantation cramps, which occur when the fertilized egg implants in your uterus. You'll be able to tell it's implantation cramping and bleeding (and not your period) because it will be less than a normal period, and last just a day or two.
 
Constipation
 
If you're newly pregnant, constipation can be an early symptom. It's caused by an increase in progesterone, which relaxes smooth muscles throughout the body, including the digestive tract. This means that food passes through the intestines more slowly.
 
Mood swings
 
It's common to have mood swings during pregnancy, partly because of hormonal changes that affect neurotransmitters (chemical messengers in the brain). Everyone responds differently to these changes. Some moms-to-be experience heightened emotions, both good and bad, while others feel more depressed or anxious.
 
Note: If you've been feeling sad or hopeless or unable to cope with your daily responsibilities, call your healthcare provider or a mental health professional right away. If you have thoughts of harming yourself, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), text the Crisis Text Line (text HELLO to 741741), or call 911.
 
Abdominal bloating
 
Hormonal changes in early pregnancy may leave you feeling bloated, similar to the feeling some women have just before their period. That's why your clothes may feel more snug than usual at the waistline, even early on when your uterus is still quite small.
 
When do pregnancy symptoms start?
 
Pregnancy symptoms are different for every woman (and even every pregnancy). Some women feel the first twinges of pregnancy a week or two after conceiving, while others don't feel any different for a few months.
 
In the best study on this question to date, 136 women who were trying to get pregnant kept daily records of their symptoms from the time they stopped using birth control until they were 8 weeks pregnant. (That's counting eight weeks from the first day of their last menstrual period.) The results:
  50 percent had some pregnancy symptoms by 5 weeks pregnant 70 percent had pregnancy symptoms by 6 weeks pregnant 90 percent had pregnancy symptoms by 8 weeks pregnant  
The first sign of pregnancy was usually a missed period. The most common symptoms to follow were nausea and vomiting, fatigue, frequent urination, and breast tenderness and swelling.
 
By 8 weeks pregnant, women reported some additional pregnancy symptoms:
  Heartburn Nasal congestion Shortness of breath Lightheadedness Spider veins Itchiness Areas of darker skin (on the face, abdomen, or areolas)  
Other symptoms that pop up throughout pregnancy include:
  Forgetfulness Dizziness Food cravings Increased appetite Lower back pain Diarrhea Headaches Rashes Glowing skin Hair and nail changes Leaking breasts Pelvic pain Sciatica Pubic symphysis dysfunction Swelling Vision changes Hemorrhoids Clumsiness Nosebleeds Increased vaginal discharge  
When should I take a pregnancy test?
 
Some home pregnancy tests claim they're sensitive enough to give a positive result as early as five days before you would expect your period. But you're more likely to get an accurate result if you wait to test until after the first day of your missed period. If you test too early, you may get a false negative pregnancy test or an unclear result like a faint line.
 
If you test and get a negative result, but still have pregnancy symptoms and/or no period, try again in a few days. Test first thing in the morning, when your urine is more concentrated. Home pregnancy tests measure the amount of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine. During early pregnancy, hCG levels typically double every two to three days.
 
Remember that your baby begins to develop before you can tell you're pregnant, so take care of your health while you're waiting to find out. If you haven't already, start taking a daily prenatal vitamin with at least 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid.
 
Once you've gotten a positive pregnancy test result, make your first prenatal appointment. Good prenatal care is essential for you and your baby. If you don't have a doctor or a midwife to care for you during pregnancy, start asking for recommendations and see who's covered by your insurance. There are options if you don't have health insurance or need low-cost prenatal care.

8	how to get pregnant	What do implantation cramps feel like?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/implantation-cramps_40008260	"What do implantation cramps feel like?

What does implantation feel like?
Many women don't have any implantation symptoms, but some have mild cramping. An early sign of pregnancy, implantation cramps happen when the fertilized egg (at this point called a blastocyst) nestles into the lining of your uterus. This may be accompanied by spotting or light implantation bleeding – much less than you would have with a normal period.
Not every woman has implantation cramps, though, so don't worry if you never feel them. This doesn't mean anything about the health of your pregnancy.
Where do you feel implantation cramps?
If you have them, you'll feel implantation cramps in your lower abdomen, in the middle rather than on one side. (It's your uterus that's cramping, even if the implantation is happening in one area.) You may also feel the cramping in your lower back.
When does implantation cramping occur?
Implantation cramping typically occurs between seven and 14 days after fertilization (if you have an average, 28-day menstrual cycle). This would put it between day 21 and 28 from the first day of your last period, or about the time you might otherwise get your next period.
Implantation cramps usually last for a day or two, or three at the most.
Other implantation signs and symptoms
Besides cramping, you might also have some light bleeding. It would be light pink or brown rather than red like your period, and it would be a small amount. Many women notice the spotting when they wipe after using the restroom.
""The spotting generally lasts a few days at most,"" says Shannon Smith, M.D., an ob-gyn at Brigham Faulkner Ob/Gyn Associates in Boston. ""As long as you're not having period-like, bright-red bleeding, there's absolutely no cause for alarm.""
At first, it's easy to mistake implantation bleeding for your period. But if the amount of blood doesn't increase, and your flow doesn't last as long as usual or get heavier, you have reason to suspect implantation bleeding. To find out for sure, take a pregnancy test the day you miss your period or a few days after that.
What else might be causing my cramping?
If you're having cramping and it's not implantation, you might have a digestive problem, such as gas or a stomach flu. Or you may be feeling an egg release from your ovary. The name for this ovulation pain is Mittelschmerz. You would feel it on one side of your lower abdomen about halfway through your menstrual cycle – so earlier in your cycle than implantation cramps.

Contact your healthcare provider if you have:Severe painBright-red bleedingA feverNausea
These signs may indicate something that needs medical attention, such as an ectopic pregnancy, an ovarian cyst, appendicitis, or a miscarriage.
What can I do to relieve the cramping?
Implantation cramps are rarely severe enough to warrant treatment, but if they're making you uncomfortable, you might try:A warm compress on your pelvis. You can also use a heating pad, but to be safe, keep the temperature below about 100 degrees F and only use it for 10 minutes at a time.A warm bath or showerRelaxation exercisesAn over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen

Implantation bleeding
 
Implantation bleeding is light bleeding that a small percentage of pregnant women have at about six to 12 days after fertilization. Here's the theory behind why it happens:
 
After the sperm fertilizes the egg, it starts the three- or four-day trip from the fallopian tube to your uterus. During this time, it divides into hundreds of identical cells. Meanwhile, your ovaries release estrogen that causes the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) to thicken and develop more blood vessels. The uterine lining is preparing to host the quickly growing egg that will soon become an embryo.
 
Once the egg enters the uterus, it's called a blastocyst, a tiny ball of several hundred cells. A day or two later, it begins burrowing into the blood-rich lining of your uterus, where it continues to grow and divide. As it burrows into the endometrium, the blastocyst may cause little blood vessels to burst, resulting in a small amount of vaginal bleeding.
Implantation bleeding symptoms
 
In addition to light bleeding, some women also have these other implantation symptoms:
 Light cramping (less than with a normal period)NauseaBreast tendernessLower back painMood swingsHeadaches 
Note that these symptoms are no guarantee that you're pregnant – they can also be signs of ovulation or PMS. Taking a home pregnancy test is the best way to find out if you're pregnant. (Though you may have to wait a few more days to get an accurate result.)
 
If you do get your period instead of a positive pregnancy test, and haven't yet scheduled a preconception visit with a midwife or doctor, now is a good time to do so.
When does implantation bleeding occur?
 
Implantation bleeding tends to occur during the week before you would expect your period, or about six to 12 days after conception. This is around the same time a fertilized egg would be attaching itself to the uterine lining.
 
How long does implantation bleeding last?
 
Unlike a regular menstrual period, implantation bleeding usually lasts no more than a day or two. This is the amount of time it takes for the fertilized egg to become implanted into the lining of the uterus.

How common is implantation bleeding?
 
By some estimates, about 15 to 25 percent of women experience implantation bleeding. Some women may think they’re having a light period when they see the spotting. They may not realize they're pregnant.
 
How can I tell if it's implantation bleeding or my period?
 
Here's how to tell whether your bleeding is more likely to be implantation bleeding or your period:
 Amount of blood. Implantation bleeding is a lot lighter than a typical period. It's usually just a little spotting.Length of time. Most women bleed for three to seven days during their period. Implantation bleeding often lasts only one to three days.Color. Menstrual blood is usually bright red or dark red, but implantation bleeding tends to be a light pink, brown, or rust discharge.Clotting. Many women bleed enough during their period that some of the blood clots or becomes like a gel. Implantation bleeding is too light to clot. 
When to see a doctor for bleeding in early pregnancy
 
If you continue spotting even after a positive pregnancy test, or if you develop other symptoms (such as pelvic or abdominal pain, dizziness, or lightheadedness), call your provider immediately.
 
You may need an exam to make sure you don't have an ectopic pregnancy. This happens when the fertilized egg grows outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. (It's possible to have an ectopic pregnancy even if you don't get a positive result on a pregnancy test.)
 
Bleeding or cramping in early pregnancy may also be a sign of an impending miscarriage. But many women spot in the first trimester for no apparent reason and go on to have a completely normal pregnancy.

10	how to get pregnant	Can you get your period while pregnant?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/can-you-get-your-period-while-youre-pregnant_7102	"Can you get your period while pregnant?

You can't have your menstrual period while pregnant, although some women do have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Some even report intermittent bleeding that seems like a regular period to them. But vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is not the same thing as menstruation.
Learn why spotting might be normal during pregnancy, plus why it's important to let your provider know if you have any bleeding or spotting while pregnant.
Why you can't have your period while pregnant
 
Menstruation only happens when you're not pregnant. Each month, your uterus grows a thick blood-rich lining in preparation for an egg to embed there. If you don't get pregnant that month, you shed this tissue and blood, and this is your menstrual period.
 
But once an egg embeds in the uterine lining, hormones tell the blood-rich tissue to stay intact to support the growing baby. And you won't shed it and start having your period again until your pregnancy is over.
 
Is spotting normal during pregnancy?
 
Non-period bleeding occurs during pregnancy for various reasons. It's important to know the difference between spotting and bleeding. Spotting is a few drops of blood every now and then on your underwear, but not enough to cover a panty liner. Bleeding, on the other hand, is a heavier blood flow for which you'll need a liner or pad to prevent the blood from soaking your clothes.
 
Some spotting in early pregnancy is normal, and happens in 15 to 25 percent of pregnancies. The cervix may bleed more easily in pregnancy because more blood vessels are developing there. Spotting may happen in the 10 to 14 days after conception when the fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus. This is known as ""implantation bleeding.""
 
Other reasons for spotting during pregnancy include:
  Having sex Hormone changes Having a Pap smear or vaginal exam Vaginitis or a sexually transmitted infection  
Always call your provider if you experience bleeding or spotting during pregnancy. It could be a sign of something more serious, such as an infection, placenta problems, impending miscarriage, or an ectopic pregnancy, which can be life-threatening. (See our article on vaginal bleeding in pregnancy for a complete rundown of possible causes.)
Advertisement  | page continues below
 
 
How long will spotting last during pregnancy?
 
Unlike your menstrual period, spotting during pregnancy only lasts about 1 to 2 days. If this spotting is implantation bleeding, it likely occurs a few days sooner than your next expected period. It will be much lighter and not require you to change a pad. Implantation bleeding doesn't require treatment and stops on its own. Even if you just think you're having implantation bleeding, be sure to call your healthcare provider to let them know.
 
What to do if you're bleeding or spotting during pregnancy
 
Call your doctor or midwife immediately at the sign of bleeding or spotting during pregnancy – even if the bleeding has stopped. Many women who bleed a little during pregnancy go on to deliver without complications, but you may need an evaluation to rule out any serious problems. Look out for other symptoms as well:
  Cramping or contractions Pelvic or abdominal pain Dizziness or fainting Fever or chills Signs of preterm labor, such as your water breaking  
Go to the nearest emergency room if your doctor's office is closed and you can't reach your provider. If they determine your bleeding isn't serious, potential treatments may include things like relaxing and avoiding sex, travel, and rigorous exercise. It's important that you follow your provider's recommendations, to keep both yourself and your baby healthy."

Yes, it's possible to get pregnant right after, on, or even just before your period. The likelihood of getting pregnant varies depending on timing and the length of your cycle.
 
If you're  trying to get pregnant, the best time to have sex is just before or during ovulation. If you're not trying to get pregnant, use reliable contraception no matter which day of your cycle it is.
 
Here's a rundown of your chances of getting pregnant during your period, and on the days before and after it.
 
Can you get pregnant on your period?
 
Yes, but it's unlikely. It's possible to get pregnant during your period when:
 You have a very short menstrual cycle (the time from the first day of one period to the first day of your next period).You have long periods.You were bleeding around the time of ovulation (spotting between periods) and mistakenly thought it was a regular period. If you had unprotected sex at that time, you could conceive. 
Here's why you could get pregnant during your period:
 Ovulation happens during the middle of your menstrual cycle – anywhere between 7 and 19 days before your period starts. During ovulation, an egg reaches maturity in one of your two ovaries, the ovary releases the egg into your abdomen, and it gets sucked into the nearest fallopian tube, where it can survive for about 24 hours. Conception occurs when an egg and sperm meet in a fallopian tube.
 
A typical menstrual cycle is 28 days, which usually leaves a good few days between the end of your period and the start of ovulation. But some women have cycles as short as 22 days. If you have a short cycle or long periods, you could ovulate right after your period ends. And because sperm can survive in your reproductive tract for up to five days, if you have sex during your period, it's possible that live sperm will be there when you ovulate, ready to fertilize the egg.
 
Can you get pregnant right after your period?
 
Yes. Immediately after your period is still not the ideal time to get pregnant, but you are more likely to conceive at this time than during your period. That's because you're closer to the time when you will ovulate.
Advertisement  | page continues below
 
 
Again, two factors can increase your chances of getting pregnant right after your period:
 A short menstrual cycleA long period 
The shorter your cycle and the longer your period, the more likely it is that you'll be fertile during the last few days of your period or in the days just afterward.
 
 
Can you get pregnant right before your period?
 
Yes, but it's unlikely, and chances are even lower that you could conceive during this time than while you are on your period or right after it.  That's because the time you are fertile has probably passed.
 
However, if you have a menstrual cycle that is shorter than the typical 28 days, there are fewer days between ovulation and the start of your next period during which you are not fertile. That means your chances of getting pregnant right before your period are higher if you have a shorter cycle and lower if you have a longer cycle.

15	how to get pregnant	How often should you have sex to get pregnant?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/can-having-too-much-sex-affect-our-chances-of-conception_6145	"How often should you have sex to get pregnant?

You may have heard that having sex twice a day during ovulation makes it easier to get pregnant. It’s true that the more sex you have during this time, the better your chances, but you don’t need to stress about the exact frequency. Here's what to know about having sex to conceive, including how to recognize you're ovulating. 
When to have sex if you're trying to conceive
When it comes to having sex to get pregnant, try not to stress. Having sex during ovulation is definitely important, but how often you do it depends on you and your partner.
Science shows that the highest pregnancy rates in couples occur among those who have sex daily, or at least every other day. That's not always possible, or even enjoyable, for everyone. But if you do wonder how often you should have sex to get pregnant, a good rule of thumb is at least every two to three days soon after the end of your period. You can become pregnant if you have sex anywhere from five days before you ovulate until a day after it, so this is when you will be at your most fertile.
 
Remember, sperm can survive inside your body for about 72 hours, so if you have sex in the three day-span before ovulation, you're more likely to get pregnant because there will be sperm already there to greet your just-released egg. The lifespan of an egg once released is only about 24 hours, so if sperm arrive even just 12 to 24 hours after you ovulate, it may be too late already.
 
Signs of ovulation to watch for
 
If you're trying to conceive, it's important to watch for ovulation signs. Most women ovulate about halfway through their menstrual cycle. That means if you have a 28-day cycle, you can expect to ovulate around day 14. But if your periods are irregular, it can be more challenging. You'll want to also be alert to the signs of ovulation. There are two main signs to watch for:
  Changes in cervical mucus. Just before you ovulate, you'll notice that you produce more mucus that's thin and slippery (it's often likened to an egg-white consistency). Right after ovulation, it decreases and thickens. If you want to get pregnant, have intercourse at least every other day when you notice the thin and slippery cervical mucus. An increase in your basal body temperature (BBT). Your BBT is your body's temperature at rest. It increases by half a degree to a degree during ovulation and remains there until your next period. Your most fertile days are the two to three days before this temperature increase. You can keep tabs on your BBT if you take your temperature every morning before you get up. While this temperature spike occurs too late to make a baby, you can use this information to time sex going forward. 
 
This can be a lot to keep track of, so another, easier option is to use an over-the-counter ovulation predictor kit. These are up to 99 percent effective in identifying when you're about to ovulate. They track your body's production of luteinizing hormone, which rises 24 to 48 hours before you ovulate. This gives you a couple of days to have sex before the egg release happens.
 
Is it possible to have too much sex if you're trying to conceive?
 
No, you can't have too much of a good thing. In fact, research even suggests that the more often a woman has sex, the more likely her immune system is to realize it's time to get pregnant. One 2015 study published in the journal Fertility & Sterility found that women who are very sexually active have greater changes in their helper T cells, which are cells that prevent your body from viewing sperm as an invader and attacking it. This theoretically make it easier for you to conceive.
 
The only downside to too much sex is if it stresses you out. That itself can affect your cycle. If having sex twice a day during ovulation is too much for you, then scale back.

Other tips for trying to conceive
 
There's more to trying to get pregnant than just having sex. Other things you can do to help include:
  Staying at a healthy weight. If you're overweight or underweight, it can impact your fertility. Don't smoke or drink too much alcohol. Both can lead to decreased fertility. Limit caffeine. Try to keep it to around 200 milligrams a day, or two eight-ounce cups of coffee. Don't work out too much. Regular exercise is good for you, but strenuous exercise for more than five hours a week can make it harder to ovulate. "
16	how to get pregnant	How babies are made	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/getting-pregnant-sex_7056	"How babies are made

How do women's eggs develop?
 
For women, a potential pregnancy begins in the ovaries, those two almond-shaped glands attached to either side of the uterus. (See illustration below.)
 
 
Ovaries come fully stocked: Newborn baby girls are born with about 2 million eggs that have developed in utero – that's more than a lifetime's supply. The eggs begin dying off almost immediately, and no more are ever produced.
 
At the time of her first period, a young woman has approximately a couple hundred thousand eggs. An accelerated decline begins at age 37 or 38, with about a thousand eggs left at menopause (usually between age 45 and 55).
 
During the middle of the menstrual cycle, most likely between days 6 and 14 for women with a 28-day cycle, follicle-stimulating hormone, produced by the pituitary gland, causes follicles in one of a woman's ovaries to begin to mature. At about day 14, an increase in luteinizing hormone, also made by the pituitary, causes the ovary to release its egg. The egg then travels through the fallopian tube to the uterus.
 
This release, called ovulation, starts the conception clock ticking. The egg lives only about 24 hours after ovulation, so it has to be fertilized soon for conception to happen. Your ""fertile window"" is the five days leading up to ovulation, as well as the day of ovulation and the day after. That's about seven days total.
 
So how do you make a baby, exactly? If your egg meets up with a healthy sperm on its way to the uterus, the two can join and begin the process of creating a new life.
 
 
If not, the egg ends its journey at the uterus, where it either dissolves or is absorbed by the body. When pregnancy doesn't occur, the ovary eventually stops making estrogen and progesterone (hormones that help maintain a pregnancy), and the thickened lining of the uterus is shed during your period.
 
How is sperm produced?
 
A man's body is almost constantly at work producing millions of microscopic sperm, whose sole purpose is to penetrate an egg. While women are born with all of the eggs they'll ever need, men aren't born with ready-made sperm. They have to be produced on a regular basis, beginning at the onset of puberty when a man begins to produce millions of sperm cells each day.
 
The average sperm lives only a few weeks in a man's body, and up to 500 million are released with each ejaculation. That means new sperm are always in production, ready for making a baby.
Advertisement  | page continues below
 
 
Sperm begin developing in the testicles, the two glands in the scrotal sac beneath the penis. (See illustration above.) The testicles hang outside a man's body because they're quite sensitive to temperature.
 
To produce healthy sperm, testicles have to stay about 1 to 2 degrees Celsius cooler than normal body temperature – that's around 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The sperm are stored in a part of the testicle called the epididymis before mixing with semen just prior to ejaculation.
 
Despite the millions of sperm produced and released with each ejaculation, only one can fertilize an egg – this is the case even for identical twins. (When two separate eggs are fertilized by two separate sperm in the same pregnancy, a mother has fraternal twins.)
 
The sex of the resulting embryo depends on which type of sperm burrows into the egg first. Sperm with a Y chromosome make a boy baby, and sperm with an X chromosome make a girl. Plenty of myths about how to choose a baby's sex have been circulating for centuries. Some are backed by a bit of scientific evidence, but a child's gender is pretty much randomly determined.
 
Will having an orgasm help you get pregnant?
 
Besides being pleasurable, that sensation known as an orgasm also has an important biological function. In men, having an orgasm propels sperm-rich semen into the vagina and up against the cervix, helping them reach the fallopian tubes minutes later. This gives sperm a head start on their way to the egg, which could help you get pregnant fast.
 
Some researchers theorize a woman's orgasm could help with conception – that the wavelike contractions associated with the female orgasm pull sperm farther into the cervix. But there's no real evidence that having an orgasm will help you get pregnant.
 
Still, having an orgasm couldn't hurt – and just might help – your chances of getting pregnant.
 
Does lying on your back after sex help you get pregnant?
 
Many couples also wonder whether a particular sexual position is best to make a baby. You may have heard that certain positions are ideal because they allow for deeper penetration, but there is no evidence that sex position has any effect on pregnancy rates.
 
So, do whatever you like. The most important thing about sex is that you're both having a good time and you're doing it frequently enough to have live sperm in the woman's reproductive tract during ovulation. That means you should aim to have sex every 1 to 2 days during the middle of your cycle.
 
At this point, you can't do much except cross your fingers and hope. You may have also heard that it helps if the woman stays on her back afterward with a pillow elevating her bottom so gravity can help the sperm get to the waiting egg, but there's no evidence this helps achieve pregnancy either.
 
What happens to the sperm and egg after you have sex?
 
After sex, a great deal of activity is taking place inside your body. Those millions of sperm have begun their quest to find the egg to make a baby, and it's not an easy journey.
 
The first obstacle is the acid level in your vagina, which can be deadly to sperm. Then there's your cervical mucus, which can be impenetrable, except on the days when you're most fertile. Then it miraculously thins enough for a few of the strongest sperm to get through.
 
But that's not all – the sperm that survive still have a long road ahead. They need to travel from the cervix through the uterus to the fallopian tubes. If there isn't an egg in one of the fallopian tubes after ejaculation, the sperm can live in the woman's reproductive tract for up to five days. Only a few dozen sperm ever make it to the egg. The rest get trapped, head up the wrong fallopian tube, or die along the way.
 
It's important to know that regular cannabis use by your partner can contribute to lower sperm count as well as the ability of the sperm to travel.
 
For the lucky few who get near the egg, the race isn't over. They still have to penetrate the egg's outer shell and get inside before the others.
 
And as soon as the hardiest one of the bunch makes it through, the egg changes instantaneously so that no other sperm can get in. It's like a protective shield that clamps down over the egg at the exact moment that first sperm is safely inside.
 
Now the real miracle begins. The genetic material in the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that starts dividing rapidly. At the end of this period, the embryo becomes a mass of very organized cells called a blastocyst. You're not actually pregnant until the blastocyst travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of your uterus. This is known as implantation and usually happens five to six days after fertilization.
 
That final leg of the trip can take another three days or so, but it may be a few more weeks until you miss a period and suspect that you're going to have a baby. If you miss your period or notice another sign of pregnancy, you can use a home pregnancy test to find out for sure if you have a little one on the way."

Some studies claim that a man's sperm count is higher in the morning, but the differences are so minimal, it doesn't matter much in terms of getting pregnant. Say your mate's sperm count goes from 87 million in the evening to 88 million in the morning. This may sound like a lot, but it doesn't change much in the real world. After all, it only takes one little swimmer to do the job.
There are many other more important things that affect your chances of getting pregnant, including ovulation and staying healthy. Here's your guide. 
 
Why having sex during your fertile window is more important 
 
If you really want to swing the odds of getting pregnant in your favor, you're better off focusing on timing sex close to ovulation. For women with a typical 28-day cycle, the fertile period is from around day 10 to around day 16 of the cycle. Having sex twice during this period of time should be enough for fertile couples to conceive.
 
Other ways to increase your chances of getting pregnant
 Adopt healthy habits  Eat well. Start making smart food choices now so your body will be stocked up with the nutrients you need for a healthy pregnancy. Aim for a healthy weight. Having a low or high body mass index (BMI) makes it harder for some women to become pregnant. Stop unhealthy habits such as smoking and drugs, which can interfere with fertility. Get help if you need it. Take prenatal vitamins. Nutrients your body needs for a healthy pregnancy and baby include iron, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, and – perhaps most importantly – folic acid. De-stress. While we don't know the exact connections between stress and fertility, we do know that high stress levels can affect your hormone function, which can in turn affect your menstrual cycles.  Manage pre-existing conditions 
Certain health conditions and risk factors could affect you or your baby if you become pregnant. Meeting with your doctor for a preconception visit can help you identify and address pre-existing conditions, such as depression, diabetes, or high blood pressure, that could affect pregnancy and fertility. Your doctor will also review any medications that you take to make sure they're safe for pregnancy and discuss other options if changes need to be made.
 Relax and have fun 
Try not to take all the fun out of sex by making it a job. (If you're having fertility troubles, this can be hard to do.) Don't force yourself to have sex more often just to improve your chances of conception. Healthy sperm can live for three to seven days in the female reproductive tract, so two times during your fertile period is plenty. More is not better if you're not having fun!

19	how to get pregnant	Does using a lubricant inhibit conception?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/does-using-a-lubricant-inhibit-conception_7098	"Does using a lubricant inhibit conception?

It may. There's some conflicting evidence, but a number of studies have found that vaginal lubricants can both damage sperm and interfere with their ability to travel to the uterus to fertilize an egg. This is true for many store-bought lubricants as well as for many homemade versions, such as olive oil.
 
While the pH (acidity) of cervical mucus produced just before ovulation is perfect for sperm survival and movement, the pH of most lubricants isn't sperm friendly. In fact, it's acidic enough to kill sperm. In addition, the thickness of lubricants can make it difficult for sperm to travel, and the water content can damage the sperm by causing them to absorb water.
 
The best lubricant to use when conception is your goal is foreplay. Take your time working up to intercourse. Ask your partner to do more touching, hugging, and kissing. Many women say they need 15 to 20 minutes of stimulation to get in the mood.
 
If you feel dry despite all attempts at foreplay, try using warm water as a lubricant. Water isn't toxic to sperm and won't interfere with the sperm's ability to reach the cervix.
If you still feel the need to use a lubricant while trying to become pregnant, it's best to choose one that's been shown in clinical trials to be safe and effective for conception. These are usually marketed as ""fertility friendly"" lubricants and include brands such as Pre-Seed and Conceive Plus.

  From ConceiveOnline.com 
 
When you’re trying to conceive, lots of problems can creep into the canoodling. But would it be stating the obvious to say that if you’re not having sex, you’re not going to get pregnant (at least, not the old-fashioned way)? Here are some of the ways your coupling may have cooled off, and how to restore the sizzle.
 
It’s gotten (yawn) humdrum
 
Well sure, when you’re doing it on a schedule, it’s bound to be a bit boring. “When couples are trying to conceive, it takes the spontaneity out of the act,” says Beverly Whipple, Ph.D., R.N., FAAN, professor emerita at Rutgers University College of Nursing in Newark, New Jersey. And couples who have been together a long time often feel there’s nothing new to experience with each other.
 How to turn up the heatAdd some variety back into your sex life. Just because you have to do it on certain days doesn’t mean you have to do it only in certain places. Leave the bedroom and get busy on the living room couch, or even the kitchen floor (or countertops if you’re feeling particularly adventurous). Try some different positions. And even try some different times: Instead of making love at night, try a morning romp. “When you’re just coming out of your dreams, sex can be divine,” says Gina Ogden, Ph.D., licensed marriage and family therapist in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and author of The Heart & Soul of Sex (Trumpeter, 2006). Or meet for a lunchtime tryst. “By night time most of us are exhausted and not in the relaxed state that makes sexual pleasure possible,” says Ogden.
Take advantage of sight, taste, sound, touch, and smell to heighten the experience, advises Whipple. Play Ravel’s “Bolero” (or Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s “Relax”), feed your partner some grapes, or have him massage your body with heated oil.
By changing all the variables of making love, you’ll be forced to focus on the experience again instead of just going through the motions.
The burning desire has waned
Low sexual desire is the most common sexual issue among women. And women trying to conceive may feel it even more. “Sex goes from being something we want to do, to something we have to do,” says Whipple. And who wants to do something you have to? What’s worse, men—who have the reputation of wanting it any time, anywhere—sometimes have trouble experiencing an erection when it comes to conception. “We call this the ready-teddy syndrome,” says Whipple. “The penis has a mind of its own, and it doesn’t always erect when you want it to.” Just one bad experience can lead to a major downward spiral—who’d want to put himself in the position (so to speak) for potential failure?
 How to turn up the heatBetween your fertile days, skip sexual intercourse entirely. “We always want what we can’t have,” says Ogden. Vow not to cave and you’ll be craving each other like mad when the time finally comes. On those in-between days you can forgo full-out sex and focus on foreplay.
Another way to stoke the fires: Try some tantric breathing together. Sit facing each other and take deep breaths, matching yours to your partner’s so you’re breathing in and out in the same rhythm. Within a few minutes you’ll be jumping each other’s bones. Really.
You don’t have an orgasm
Technically women don’t need to climax in order to conceive. Women trying to conceive are often overly focused on the end result—for him. But why should he have all the fun? For starters, stop skimping on the pre-game show. Women vary in how much foreplay they need to rev up for orgasm, but the key is finding the right amount of arousal time for you, says Ogden.
Advertisement  | page continues below
Also, if you’re concentrating too hard about conceiving during the act, your brain won’t be registering sensations and releasing the feel-good chemicals you need to go over the edge. While it may be impossible not to think about conception when you’re trying (it’s like telling somebody not to worry about something, which just makes them worry about it more), the best way to deal with it, says Ogden, is to acknowledge it, then find a way to let the feeling flow through you rather than try to pretend it doesn’t exist.How to turn up the heat“I’ve spoken in 94 countries about this, and women are the same all over,” says Whipple. “We’re all embarrassed to ask for what we want.” But how can you expect a man to know what makes you feel good without telling him? Find out what makes you orgasm through masturbation, then share what you’ve learned with your partner. Try bringing it up at a time when you’re together, alone, and relaxed ... but not in the middle of foreplay or intercourse. Keep it neutral and non-threatening, using “I” statements like, “I really like it when you do this,” or “Let me show you how I like to be touched,” as opposed to, “You really don’t do it for me.” If you really can’t get the words out, bring home The Joy of Sex and read it together. You can point to positions or techniques you’d like to try.
You're lacking lubrication
If you’re stressed, not in the mood, or just downright exhausted, your vagina may be dry, which makes intercourse uncomfortable. Hormones may play a factor as well: Estrogen dips in the late 30s and early 40s, causing vaginal dryness. Another possible culprit: antihistamines. They suppress the body’s production of fluid, both in your nose and in the vagina.
 How to turn up the heatHave more sex! “Women in their 40s who have sex once or twice a week have twice as much circulating estrogen as women who have sporadic sex, or none at all,” says Whipple. If you’re taking antihistamines, see about switching to a different drug. And if you need to, use some artificial lubricant—just make sure you choose one that is sperm-friendly.
You feel self-conscious about your body
Is there a woman in the world who actually thinks she looks great naked? Probably even Heidi Klum has hang-ups about her thighs. “Our society is like a training program for feeling terrible about your body,” says Ogden. “It teaches us that whatever we have it’s too big, too small, too hairy, too flat.” This can be especially relevant when you’re trying to get pregnant, because you can’t help but think, “Is he really attracted to me? Or is he just doing this because we have to?”
 How to turn up the heatThink about some of the sexiest women you know. Here’s one: Callie on ""Grey's Anatomy."" She’s certainly not like the wispy-thin waifs who dominate the media. But she is, in a word, h-o-t. Watch how she carries herself. She exudes sexiness. “Find a way to let go of the images of what you think you’re supposed to look like, and feel how your body is,” says Ogden. “Allowing yourself to truly feel your body and how it moves can actually change your entire energy field.” Take a belly dancing or yoga class to really get in tune with your own body, and soon you’ll be putting out an energy that will make every man in the room turn their heads. If you don’t feel it, fake it. You’ll be amazed at how pretending can transform into genuine feelings.
 
You're too stressed to score
It’s been said time and time again, but it’s worth repeating: The most important sex organ in the body is the brain. If your mind is telling you that you should be working, or the light bulb needs changing, or the dog needs to go to the vet, you’re not going to be in the sexiest frame of mind. “Also, stress often causes emotional upset, depression, and anger, and we often blame our partners when we’re feeling down, which in turn creates sexual problems,” says Peter S. Kanaris, Ph.D., a psychologist and certified sex therapist in Smithtown, New York.How to turn up the heatOnce you recognize the issue, you and your partner can take steps to solve it. Instead of blaming each other for the stress, realize you’re in the same boat and try to work it out as a team. Use sex as part of the solution as opposed to it being another stressor in your life. “Intimacy can be a little safe haven where we turn to each other in times of stress,” says Kanaris. In addition to the psychological boost sex can give, touch can actually help reduce stress-hormone levels.
Also, be sure you both find some outlets in addition to sex that can help relieve stress over the long haul. Yoga, meditation, even long walks can help clear your mind. “It goes without saying that having difficulty conceiving is stressful for any couple,” says Whipple.
He can't climax
Nope, that’s not a typo; some men do have difficulty ejaculating. “It’s one of the least reported, and least understood sexual problems,” says Kanaris. “I think it happens more often than we think.” Often it’s the result of masturbation—when a man has literally trained himself only to orgasm in a certain way. That can leave a partner thinking she’s not enough of a turn-on for her partner to orgasm. Alcohol and certain drugs (including antidepressants) can also be the cause.How to turn up the heatLet him show you how he masturbates, so you can see what he likes. Or try this surefire hit: Press your fingers against the area right behind the base of the scrotum, says Dennis P. Sugrue, Ph.D., associate clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. “This is where the prostate gland is located, and it’s highly arousing,” he says. And most of all, try to relax. To (mis)use a cliché, a watched pot never boils. (If antidepressants or other medications are to blame, see if a different prescription can help with symptoms without the side effects.)
He comes too quickly
Years of masturbating as a young boy and hoping he’d finish before Mom or Aunt Harriet walked in can lead to hasty orgasms as an adult. While it may not hurt in the conception department, it can’t possibly be all that much fun for him, or for you.How to turn up the heatMany experts recommend the start and stop method. Tell him that when he feels he’s about to climax, to stay still and take a few relaxing breaths."

You've probably seen the viral trend: women who claim they struggled with infertility for years, took Mucinex to help them cope with a cold or COVID, and boom! Suddenly they're pregnant. Unfortunately, there's not good evidence that Mucinex, or any cough syrup for that matter, can help you conceive. Here's what you need to know.
 
Where did the theory surrounding Mucinex and pregnancy come from?
 
This comes, believe it or not, from a study published 40 years ago in the journal Fertility & Sterility. Researchers looked at 40 couples who had struggled with infertility for at least ten months. Each woman was given guaifenesin – one of the active ingredients in Mucinex – three times a day from day five of the start of her period until she showed a rise in her basal body temperature to indicate ovulation.
Then the couples underwent post-coital testing, which means doctors checked to see how well their partner's sperm responded to their cervical mucus. Of the 23 patients who had ""marked improvement,"" 15, or about two-thirds, became pregnant. Women whose infertility appeared tied to their cervical mucus got pregnant on average within 2.4 months, while women with additional fertility problems became pregnant on average within about 5.6 months.
 
What is guaifenesin?
 
Guaifensin is the over-the-counter ingredient in cough syrups such as Mucinex that is theorized to help with fertility. It's been around since the 1950s and has long been used to treat cough, to loosen phlegm and expel it from your lungs. It works to thin out mucus and make it less sticky. As a result, it makes it easier for your lungs to get rid of it, and it changes a dry, unproductive cough to one that's more productive and less frequent. Since it works on all the mucus in your body, the theory is that it can make your cervical mucus more liquid-y, too.
 
Can taking Mucinex or other cough syrups really help you get pregnant?
 
Probably not. There's really not much evidence to justify its use for this purpose. Proponents claim that it may help you get pregnant by making your cervical fluid wetter and more slippery, which makes it easier for sperm to travel through your cervix to fertilize an egg. But other than the 1982 study, there isn't any research to support this.
A 2011 case report published in the International Journal of General Medicine found that guaifenesin increased sperm counts and motility in a 32-year-old man who took 600 mg twice daily for two months. But that's just one person. There aren't any well designed studies to show it actually works.
 
Safe ways to use Mucinex or other cough syrups when trying to get pregnant
 
If you want to use Mucinex or another cough syrup to try to get pregnant, talk to your provider first. They can advise you on whether or not they recommend it, and if they do, what dosage to use. Just keep in mind there's not enough research to show it helps fertility. In addition, like any medication, Mucinex (guifenisen) has side effects. You could experience dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea, abdominal pain and/or vomiting when taking it.
 
Instead of recommending cough medicine, your doctors will likely recommend that you take the following steps to help boost your fertility:
  Maintain a healthy weight. Up to twelve percent of all infertility cases are due to the woman being overweight or underweight, according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. Be sure to talk with your provider about ways to stay at a healthy weight while trying to conceive.  Don't smoke. Up to thirteen percent of cases of female infertility are caused by cigarette smoking. If you do smoke, see your provider to learn how to quit. They can help you come up a plan that works with your lifestyle and fertility goals. Eat a healthy diet. One study, known as the Nurses' Health Study II, found that a ""fertility diet"" that was rich in monounsaturated fats, vegetable sources of protein, dairy and low-glycemic carbohydrates was associated with a lower risk of infertility. And it's always a good idea to eat healthily. Doing so has lots of additional health benefits, like lowering cholesterol, blood pressure, and stress levels – all good things to have in check before TTC.

Acupuncture uses thin needles to stimulate various pressure points around the body. It's sometimes used to treat infertility, for example for women going through vitro fertilization (IVF). Although research hasn't confirmed it improves your odds of getting pregnant, it's safe to try acupuncture for fertility. 
What is acupuncture?
 
Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that's been used to treat everything from labor pain and period cramps to nausea and infertility.
 
The practice is based on the theory that vital energy (or ""qi,"" pronounced ""chi"") flows through the body along certain pathways. Acupuncturists try to re-balance this energy and restore health by stimulating specific points along those pathways with thin needles.
 
Although acupuncture has been a staple of Chinese medicine for some 3,000 years, it has only become more accepted and popular in America over the past few decades. From a Western medicine perspective, acupuncture appears to work by stimulating the release of natural painkillers that have a variety of effects on the body.
 
What does acupuncture feel like?
 
Acupuncture needles are very thin, about the width of a hair. They're solid, not hollow like the needle your provider uses when giving you a vaccine, so they don't hurt as much (if at all). You might feel a small pinch, an aching feeling, or a sensation of pressure when each needle goes in, but most people don't find the process painful.
 
Some people do have an emotional reaction to acupuncture. It's normal to suddenly feel elated, energized, or sad. These feelings are temporary.
 
Alternative types of acupuncture apply heat (moxibustion), pressure (acupressure), suction (cupping), or a mild electric current through the needles. These techniques might feel a little different than traditional needling.
 
All acupuncturists have slightly different practices, but many times they'll start your visit by discussing your symptoms or goals to determine which pressure points they think would be beneficial to target that day. Typically, your acupuncturist will then insert the needles and let you relax or sleep for 30 minutes or so until they take them out.
 
Can acupuncture help with infertility?
 
Whether acupuncture has any fertility benefit is a hard question to answer. Some research suggests the practice may be helpful during in-vitro fertilization (IVF), but the existing evidence isn't sufficient or high-quality enough to confirm these findings. We need more research before we can say for sure that this age-old therapy can improve the odds of a pregnancy.
 
In theory, acupuncture has effects on the body that can promote pregnancy. For example, studies have shown that it lowers cortisol levels. Having high levels of this stress hormone can make it harder to conceive. Acupuncture also stimulates the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and gonadotropin, hormones that are essential for getting pregnant.
Advertisement  | page continues below
 
 
But in reality, studies haven't been able to prove that acupuncture works for fertility specifically. A Cochrane review of eight studies that included more than 1,500 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) couldn't confirm that acupuncture had any effect on ovulation, pregnancy rate, or birth rate. The authors said the evidence was simply lacking.
 
Acupuncture during IVF doesn't have proven results, either. In one large study, women who had acupuncture around the time of their ovarian stimulation process and embryo transfer weren't any more likely to give birth than those who had sham (fake) acupuncture.
 
When researchers in China analyzed the evidence on acupuncture done without assisted reproductive technologies (ART) like IVF, they concluded that it might be effective. However, they couldn't say so for sure due to the low quality of the studies.
 
Where acupuncture might have the greatest benefit is for reducing stress and anxiety during IVF (or even while trying to conceive). Since stress has been shown to interfere with getting pregnant, it makes sense that reducing your stress with acupuncture could theoretically improve your odds of conceiving.
 
Research has also investigated acupuncture for boosting fertility in men. Although one study showed an improvement in sperm count and blood flow to the testicles, the treatment didn't affect sperm movement and concentration, and there was no evidence that it increased the odds of a pregnancy or birth.
 
Most experts believe that we need larger and better studies, using fake needles for some patients and real ones for others, to truly know whether acupuncture is effective. In studies where patients and health care providers knew that acupuncture was performed, the success of the treatment might have been due to what's known as the placebo effect. Perhaps it was the patients' belief in acupuncture – rather than the acupuncture itself – that caused the treatment to be successful.
 
Are there any risks to having acupuncture for fertility?
 
There are very few risks to trying this treatment, as long as you go to a licensed and experienced acupuncturist who uses sterile needles. The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture has a database of licensed acupuncturists around the country.
 
The most common side effects from acupuncture are mild and don't last long, including:
  Soreness at the needle sites Minor bleeding Bruising Dizziness or feeling like you're going to faint  
Let your acupuncturist know if you have a bleeding disorder or you're on a blood thinner like warfarin (Coumadin), which could increase your bleeding risk. You may need to avoid acupuncture if you have a metal allergy or an infection in or around the area where the needles will be inserted.
 
Acupuncture points for fertility
 
For treating fertility, acupuncturists place needles along points that are related to the reproductive organs and nervous system. The aim is to balance your hormones, improve how your ovaries function, and increase blood flow to your uterine lining.
 
Some of the acupuncture points that have been used for fertility in studies are located:
  On the top of the hand, near the thumb Just below the knee on the front and sides of the leg Above the ankle In the lower belly Next to the belly button Behind or in the ears In the middle of the back along the spine  
The exact points used vary from one acupuncturist to another, and from one treatment to another. Depending on where you are in your cycle, your acupuncturist may target different points.
 
Is acupuncture safe if you become pregnant?
 
For most women, acupuncture is safe during pregnancy. Some women find that acupuncture makes them feel more relaxed and helps with pregnancy discomforts like lower back and pelvic pain. But having any kind of medical procedure during pregnancy, even one that's as safe as acupuncture, is worth considering carefully.
 
Evidence shows that acupuncture is safe during pregnancy, provided that your acupuncturist is experienced and follows the proper precautions, which includes using sterile needles. In one review of 105 studies, the main side effects during pregnancy were mild – including pain and slight bleeding at the needling site. Any severe side effects that women in the studies experienced were likely not caused by acupuncture, the experts concluded.
 
You might have heard about ""forbidden points"" – areas like the lower belly that have raised concerns during pregnancy because they theoretically might induce labor early. Studies of women who received acupuncture in these points at all pregnancy stages showed no increased risk of miscarriage or preterm labor compared to women who didn't have acupuncture. But if you're at all worried, ask your acupuncturist to avoid the ""forbidden"" points.
 
What to expect at your acupuncture appointment
 
Your experience will differ based on which acupuncturist you see. Every provider has their own unique style. Some follow a more traditional approach, while others blend elements of Western medicine into their practice.
 
Your practitioner will likely start your first visit by learning about your health and what you're hoping to accomplish. They'll use that information to figure out the right treatment approach for you.
 
Before the needles go in, the acupuncturist will clean each treatment area. Then they'll place the needles into various points around your body. Some acupuncture treatments add heat, pressure, or an electric current. Expect the needles to stay in place for a total of 25 to 35 minutes.
 
Acupuncture is often given in a series of visits. You might see your acupuncturist once or twice a week for a total of six to eight sessions. And some women have regular acupuncture appointments for even longer than a few weeks or months. Each appointment will last for about an hour.
 
How to prepare for your acupuncture appointment
 
The best first step to treating any fertility problem is to contact a fertility specialist. If you decide to try acupuncture, look for a certified acupuncturist. The National Institutes of Health offers tips on finding a licensed acupuncturist.
 
You don't need to do any special preparation for your appointment, other than wearing loose-fitting clothing so that your acupuncturist can access different areas of your body. Eat a light snack about two hours before your appointment. You don't want to be too hungry or too full. And bring along a list of the medications and supplements you take, including herbal remedies, to share with your acupuncturist."

Hot tubs are fine for women who are trying to conceive, but may have a (temporary) negative effect on a male partner's sperm. Once you're pregnant though, it's recommended that you avoid hot tubs, since an elevated body temperature could be harmful to your baby.
Here's how to navigate a little relaxation if you're trying to conceive. 
Will hot tubs negatively affect a man's sperm count?
 
The short answer is yes. Men who are hoping to get their partners pregnant should avoid frequent or prolonged soaks in the hot tub while trying to conceive. Studies show a significant reduction in sperm count, sperm motility (movement), sperm concentration (volume), and sperm morphology (shape) – all of which are measured during a semen analysis – when the testes and scrotum are repeatedly exposed to heat, even if the temperature is elevated by just a few degrees.
 
There's also some evidence that heat exposure can damage DNA in sperm. Men's testes are outside the body for a reason: They need to be in a cooler environment to produce healthy sperm.
 
The good news, however, is that regular dips in the jacuzzi only have short-term implications for male fertility. About three or four months after putting his hot tub habits on hold, the male partner is likely to return to his normal sperm levels during a subsequent semen analysis.
 
Is it okay to get in a hot tub if I'm trying to conceive?
 
Yes, it's okay to get in a hot tub if you're trying to get pregnant. That's because there's no evidence or science-backed research to suggest that a hot tub has a negative effect on female fertility like it does on male fertility. That means that neither the heat from the water or chemicals in the hot tub will mess with your eggs or your ovulation cycle.
 
Keep in mind though that many other lifestyle choices do affect a woman's fertility and the quality of her eggs, such as nutrition, exercise, smoking, BMI, and psychological factors such as stress and anxiety. Age is the biggest factor in a woman's ability to get pregnant, and fertility rates steadily decline starting around the age of 35.
 
Is it okay to get in a hot tub while pregnant?
 
Once you're pregnant, it's best to avoid the hot tub. Some studies show that raising your body temperature in a hot tub, sauna, or hot yoga class, especially during the first trimester, increases the risk of neural tube birth defects and other congenital anomalies. Your body temperature can reach 101 degrees in just ten minutes in a hot tub, which is why it's recommended that you avoid the hot tub all together if you're expecting. 
 
It is okay to take a warm bath while pregnant as long as the water temperature stays at or below 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

Can I get pregnant in a hot tub?
 
You can get pregnant in a hot tub (and any other water, for that matter) if you're having unprotected, penetrative sex with a male partner.
 
But the idea that you can get pregnant from free-floating sperm in a hot tub without having intercourse is just a myth. Sperm can only live in hot water for a few seconds before dying off, and the chemicals used in the hot tub water would kill sperm too. Plus, the odds that sperm could enter the vagina and fertilize an egg under these conditions are extremely low."
30	how to get pregnant	Can a yeast infection cause infertility?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/can-a-yeast-infection-affect-my-fertility_1404535	"Can a yeast infection cause infertility?

No, having a yeast infection won't directly affect your chances of getting pregnant, but it might impact you in another way. The reason? The itchiness, irritation, soreness and swelling that the infection brings may cause sex to be uncomfortable. But don't worry, symptoms usually subside in less than a week if treated. 
What is a yeast infection?
 
A yeast infection, which affects as many as three in four women at some point in their lives, is a fungal infection of the vagina and vulva. In fact, many women have at least two yeast infections throughout their lifetime, experiencing itchiness and a white, cheesy discharge. A yeast infection, which is also known as vaginal candidiasis, can also cause burning, irritation, and a rash on the outer lips of the vagina.
 
What causes a yeast infection?
 
Most yeast infections are caused by a common fungus called candida albicans. Normally, the acid balance of the vagina keeps this fungus from multiplying. But a change in the vagina’s acidity can lead to an overgrowth of candida and prompt yeast – and an infection – to develop.
 
Too much yeast may be due to illness or an impaired immune system, menstruation, pregnancy, certain antibiotics, uncontrolled diabetes or birth control pills. Moist, tight clothing such as a wet bathing suit can also provide a prime breeding ground for yeast.
 
Can a yeast infection affect my ability to get pregnant?
 
Having a yeast infection does not affect your fertility, but having sex may be uncomfortable for a few days. Just watch out for certain yeast infection symptoms that may mimic more serious conditions. These may include bacterial vaginosis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, which infect the cervix and can cause scarring and blockage of your fallopian tubes, affecting your ability to get pregnant.
 
What can I do if I get a yeast infection while trying to get pregnant?
 
If you get a yeast infection while you’re trying to conceive, you can rest easy. This very common condition is simple to treat when symptoms are mild to moderate with over-the-counter vaginal antifungal medications (creams, tablets, suppositories) or the oral prescription drug Diflucan (fluconazole). Most medications work quickly too, in three to seven days.
 
Severe symptoms, however, may require a different approach with long-course vaginal therapy, like an antifungal that you take daily for up to two weeks and then continue weekly for several months. There's no danger in having sex while you're taking antifungal medications, but intercourse may further irritate the soreness and irritation you feel and delay healing.
 
If your symptoms don't go away after you finish taking the medication, see your provider, who can test for other infections with similar symptoms. It’s best to rule out and treat any other illnesses so you can clear the way for lots of healthy intercourse – and maybe even a baby on the way.

31	how to get pregnant	Is it safe to take medication while trying to conceive?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/what-medications-should-i-stop-taking-now-that-im-trying_7089	"Is it safe to take medication while trying to conceive?

If you're trying to conceive, it may be safer to continue taking your medications than to stop. The most important thing to remember is that you need to talk with your doctor before changing anything about your prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and supplements, that you take.
The goal when you're trying to become pregnant is to stop taking unnecessary medications and avoid certain medicines that can increase the risk for birth defects, pregnancy loss, prematurity, infant death, or developmental disabilities. However, that does not mean stopping all medication. Many medical conditions require continued treatment during pregnancy, and you can work with your doctor to find safe and effective medications while trying to conceive and during pregnancy.
 
Learn if you'll have to avoid any medication specifically, and whether you'll need to replace anything you're currently taking. 
 
Medications to avoid while TTC
 
When you're trying to conceive, talk to your doctor about any medications that you should avoid. There are a few medications you should definitely avoid because they can interfere with normal fetal development, cause birth defects, or increase miscarriage risk: Isotretinoin, better known as Accutane, used to treat acne Methotrexate, used as chemotherapy and for some types of arthritisTetracycline, used for acne or infectionsValproic acid to treat epilepsyACE inhibitors, typically used to treat hypertension 
Make sure you talk with your doctor before you stop taking any prescription medication.
 
Many over-the-counter medications, such as certain allergy medicines and Tylenol (acetaminophen), are safe while trying to conceive (and if you become pregnant). However, always read the labels and talk to your doctor before taking any medications. Some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as Motrin, Aleve, or any drug containing ibuprofen, aren't recommended during pregnancy. 
 
Will I have to replace my medication with a pregnancy-safe option while trying to conceive?
 
It all depends on your individual situation. The best advice is to check with your obstetrician and prescribing physician, if different, before stopping or changing any medication.
Many medications have safer alternatives for pregnant women. For example, if you need an anticoagulant for a deep vein thrombosis, heparin is safe – and Coumadin (warfarin) is dangerous because it crosses the placenta. However, there are some high-risk conditions for which Coumadin is still recommended. Or if you need an anticonvulsant for epilepsy, Keppra and dilantin are believed to be safer than valproic acid.

If you get pregnant unexpectedly, call your doctor as quickly as possible to discuss what you're taking and if any changes are recommended. Don't stop any prescription medication without consulting your provider."
32	how to get pregnant	What's the best time of year to get pregnant?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/whats-the-best-time-of-year-to-get-pregnant_40007662	"What's the best time of year to get pregnant?

If you live in southern areas of the U.S., your chances of conceiving in that window of time are especially high, according to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction. The researchers analyzed data on more than 14,000 women who had been trying to get pregnant for under six months. Almost 6,000 of the women were from the U.S. and Canada, and the rest were in Denmark. The women enrolled in the studies answered regular surveys to record their attempts to get pregnant and when or if they actually conceived (77 percent did during the study period), along with other information that could influence pregnancy such as diet and smoking. None of the women were getting fertility treatment.
Danish couples also had better luck getting pregnant in late fall, but the trend was weaker than in the U.S.
 
The study is one of the first to examine when women are most likely to conceive, rather than looking at when they're most likely to give birth. Births in the U.S. peak in August and September, the authors said, which lines up pretty squarely with this study's findings on when couples most commonly conceive.
So why is late fall such a fertile time for North American women? Well, that burning question will have to be answered by future studies. This one didn't investigate the reasons. But the researchers did have some theories.
 
""Although this study cannot identify the reasons for seasonal variation in fertility, we are interested in exploring several hypotheses on seasonally-varying factors and how they affect fertility, including meteorological variables such as temperature and humidity, vitamin D exposure, and environmental exposures such as air pollution,"" lead author Amelia Wesselink said.
 
In other words, human fertility may be influenced in some way by our environment. Other factors could be human driven, the authors wrote. For example, couples may plan pregnancies to coincide with periods of the year when they have more time off (such as the summer), or simply because they'd prefer to have a baby during a particular month.
The study relied on women reporting their menstrual cycles and attempts to get pregnant accurately in online surveys, so the results may not be completely foolproof.
 
Of course, there are many factors that can affect your chances and decisions around getting pregnant. For more information and tips on pregnancy planning, and how to get pregnant fast, visit BabyCenter's Getting Pregnant resources page.

33	how to get pregnant	Can HPV cause infertility?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/will-having-hpv-affect-my-chances-of-getting-pregnant_1404503	"Can HPV cause infertility?

HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that usually resolves itself in a few years. But men and women with HPV can experience fertility-related side effects, including trouble getting and staying pregnant. HPV treatments can also make it harder to conceive, so here's what to know if you're thinking of trying to get pregnant.  
What is HPV?
 
HPV (human papilloma virus) is the most common sexually transmitted infection, affecting as many as 75 percent of American women and men of reproductive age. More than a hundred types or strains of the virus exist, and they can cause very different symptoms. HPV is spread through the skin-to-skin contact that happens during vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.
 
Many of the HPV strains cause warts in the vaginal area and cervix (the opening to the uterus). Often these warts are too small to see, and they're generally harmless. But a few strains of the virus are more worrisome because they can actually damage the cells of the cervix and turn them cancerous.
 
Can you get pregnant with HPV?
 
HPV is often not mentioned as a primary or common cause of infertility, but many sexually transmitted infections can make it harder to get pregnant, and that may include HPV. This can happen when a man or a woman has an HPV infection.
 
That said, most HPV infections clear up on their own within two years without causing any other health problems. So does HPV cause infertility or not?
 
There isn't quite enough research to say, but we do know that for women, HPV increases your risk of developing precancerous or cancerous cells in your cervix, which could affect both your fertility and your ability to carry a baby to term.
 
For men, HPV can have a negative effect on sperm quality and fertility outcomes, with one study suggesting that men with abnormal sperm quality were more likely to have an HPV infection and another finding that HPV detection in sperm was associated with a higher incidence of miscarriage. While HPV won't automatically make you sterile, some researchers have found a connection between HPV infections and male infertility.
 
HPV treatment options
 
Precancerous changes in the cervix can be mild to severe. In general, mild changes (called low-grade dysplasia) may not necessarily require treatment – just close follow-up care from your gynecologist.
 
If you do need treatment to remove precancerous cells before they progress to the cancerous stage, your doctor will probably use one of three techniques: removing a portion of the cervix (a cone biopsy); freezing and destroying abnormal tissue (cryosurgery), or removing cells via an electrically charged wire loop, called LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure).
 
Fortunately, cervical cancer is very treatable when caught early.

Will HPV treatment affect my chances of getting pregnant?
 
Unfortunately, some of these procedures may make it more difficult for you to get pregnant or to carry a baby to term. Cervical cell removal can sometimes affect the production of cervical mucus. Healthy, normal mucus helps sperm swim up into the reproductive tract. Without it, sperm can have a hard time reaching the egg.
 
Depending on how much tissue is removed, the treatment may also weaken the cervix, leading to a condition known as cervical insufficiency. This can make you more likely to miscarry because your cervix may open during pregnancy.
 
If you're trying to conceive, minimizing the amount of tissue removed will reduce any effect on a future pregnancy, but it's vitally important for your doctor to take out all of the abnormal cells. If precancerous cells remain untreated and develop into cervical cancer, there's a chance you'll need a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), which would rule out any future pregnancies.
 
Talk to your doctor about your future pregnancy concerns. If you're not comfortable with the answers, seek a second opinion. There may be more than one medically reasonable way to approach your situation. In general, the recommendations for treatment are getting more conservative as we learn more about HPV and cervical pre-cancer and cancer. There also may be some other strategies used, such as freezing eggs or ovarian tissues, to preserve fertility when treatment is needed.
 
Risks of having HPV
 
The main risk of having HPV is the risk of cancer. Not only can HPV cause cervical cancer, it's associated with higher risks of other types of cancers, too.
 
It's important to remember, though, that you can also pass the HPV virus to your partner during sexual intercourse or even through close sexual contact with the affected area. (If you've been having unprotected sex, they're probably already infected.)
 
If you have active HPV warts during your pregnancy, there's also a very slim chance that your baby will come into contact with the virus while passing through the birth canal and develop warts on the larynx (vocal cords).
 
How to prevent HPV
 
Unfortunately, there's no cure for HPV, but there is an HPV vaccine that protects women (and men) against the strains most likely to lead to cancer. Three doses of the vaccine are recommended for girls and boys at age 11 or 12. You can also reduce your chances of contracting HPV by using condoms during intercourse, but keep in mind that condoms aren't 100 percent protective against HPV.
 
If you get HPV, your healthcare provider can prescribe medication to treat the warts. And you can prevent the infection from progressing to cervical cancer by having yearly Pap smears and getting any precancerous cells treated quickly."
34	how to get pregnant	Can stress get in the way of getting pregnant?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/can-stress-get-in-the-way-of-getting-pregnant_1336350	"Can stress get in the way of getting pregnant?

Stress can interfere with conception. In fact, if you're having a hard time getting pregnant, people may have already said to you, ""Just relax and it will happen."" Although this can feel insulting, there's a kernel of truth to it.
That's because stress can affect the functioning of the hypothalamus – the gland in the brain that regulates your appetite and emotions, as well as the hormones that tell your ovaries to release eggs. If you're stressed out, you may ovulate later in your cycle or not at all. So if you're only having sex around day 14, thinking that you're about to ovulate, you may miss your opportunity to conceive.
It's important to differentiate between constant and sudden stress. If your stress level is high but fairly consistent, your body will likely acclimate to it and you'll probably still ovulate each cycle. It's sudden stress – such as an accident or a death in the family – that can throw your cycle off and interfere with ovulation.
Of course, this varies from woman to woman. Some women find that even a trip out of town can delay ovulation. Others have found that a severely traumatic incident didn't impact their cycle at all.
It's also important to remember that stress isn't only a reaction to something negative. Positive stress can also affect your cycle, causing you to ovulate later or not at all. Brides often report strange cycles because they're happily stressed about their weddings.
If you're trying to get pregnant and you're under stress, your cervical fluid may give you a warning that something's amiss. Rather than noticing increasing cervical fluid wetness as you approach ovulation, you might find patches of wetness interspersed with dry days. It's as if your body is trying to ovulate, but the stress continues to delay it.
You'll be able to confirm when you have indeed ovulated by tracking your basal body temperature. You should see a sustained rise about a day after ovulation, lasting about 12 to 16 days.
The good news is that delayed ovulation simply lengthens your entire cycle. It doesn't shorten the luteal phase – typically lasting 12 to 16 days after ovulation to the start of your next menstrual period. This is important because a short luteal phase has been linked to early miscarriage.
So while stress may impact when you ovulate, it won't necessarily mess with your chances of a successful pregnancy, as long as you know how to identify when ovulation is about to occur by charting your cervical fluid.

35	how to get pregnant	Is it safe to get a flu shot if I’m trying to get pregnant?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/is-it-safe-to-get-a-flu-shot-if-i-m-trying-to-get-pregnant_20004656	"Is it safe to get a flu shot if I’m trying to get pregnant?

Yes. In fact, it could even save your life.
 
Getting the flu shot while you're trying to conceive can protect you from serious complications if you become pregnant during flu season. It's so important that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes both women who are pregnant and women who will be pregnant during the flu season on its list of high-risk groups.
 
And pregnant women who get the flu are at higher risk of severe illness, sometimes requiring hospitalization, due to changes in their immune system.
 
See our article on the flu shot during pregnancy for more information on why getting the flu shot is not only safe but crucial – for your health as well as your baby's health.
 
When should I get the flu shot?
 
Both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that women who are pregnant or who will be pregnant during flu season get the shot as soon as it's available each year (usually in September or October). That's because it takes two weeks for your body to build up protective antibodies, and you want to be protected before flu season starts.
 
You can get the shot from your healthcare provider or at a pharmacy. Or try HealthMap's flu vaccine finder.
 
Which flu vaccine should I get?
 
ACOG recommends that women who are or will be pregnant during flu season receive an inactivated flu vaccine, so opt for the flu shot. (The shot is inactivated, but the nasal spray flu vaccine contains a live virus.)
 
What are the possible side effects from the flu vaccine?
 
Side effects of the flu shot are generally mild and include soreness, redness, or swelling in the area of the shot. Less common side effects include fainting, headache, fever, muscle aches, nausea, or fatigue.
 
Be sure to tell the person administering the shot if you have severe allergies, if you've had a severe allergic reaction to the flu shot in the past, or if you have Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Researchers at NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development studied conception rates among more than 1,200 women attempting to get pregnant and who had suffered one or two miscarriages in the past. Five percent of the women – 62 in total – either reported using cannabis while trying to conceive or urine tests showed they'd been using the drug.
 
The women who used cannabis – either marijuana or hashish – in the weeks prior to pregnancy were 40 percent less likely to conceive than women who did not use cannabis. The researchers followed the women through a maximum of six monthly cycles. Cannabis users also had differences in ovulation-related reproductive hormones compared to non-users, the researchers noted in the journal Human Reproduction.
 
For women who did get pregnant, the researchers did not find any difference in miscarriage rates between those who used cannabis and those who didn't.
 
The study findings suggest cannabis could interfere with women's ability to conceive. For example, animal studies have shown that cannabis may change the lining of the uterus and make it more difficult for an embryo to implant. However, the number of women in the study who used cannabis was small, and more research is needed to confirm the findings.
 
Still, the researchers advise women to be cautious about using cannabis if trying to get pregnant. Likewise, most experts agree it's best to avoid marijuana products if you get pregnant as well, because it's been linked to several birth and health problems including preterm birth, placental abruption, irritability in newborns, and developmental challenges in children.

No – there's no evidence that long-term use of the birth control pill interferes with fertility. Some women experience a disruption in their menstrual cycle for several months after going off the Pill (a condition called post-pill amenorrhea). But this is usually caused by an underlying problem that's unrelated to the Pill – for example, being significantly underweight, or even being under severe stress.
In fact, taking the Pill can protect you from diseases – such as ovarian and uterine cancers – that can lead to infertility. Researchers have also found that long-term Pill use may improve the symptoms of endometriosis, a condition that can cause abnormal menstrual bleeding and result in infertility. Finally, the Pill has been shown to reduce the incidence of ectopic pregnancy – when a fertilized egg is implanted outside the uterus, typically in one of the fallopian tubes. (Unfortunately, an ectopic pregnancy can't result in a successful birth.)
Some doctors advise trying to get pregnant as soon as you go off the Pill, but I recommend that you wait until after you get your first period – usually four to six weeks after going off the Pill. That way, you'll know you're ovulating. If you still haven't gotten your period two months after stopping the Pill, it's a good idea to check with your healthcare provider. There may be an underlying problem that needs to be addressed.
But don't be concerned if you do get pregnant right after going off hormonal contraception. Research suggests that there's no need to worry about the effects of any lingering hormones on your baby.
Remember that it's always a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider before going off any hormonal contraceptive.

38	how to get pregnant	Can smoking affect my sperm count?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/can-smoking-affect-my-sperm-count_7086	"Can smoking affect my sperm count?

Yes, it can. Smoking is not just bad for a woman who's trying to conceive – it's bad for the man as well. I recommend to all couples in fertility counseling that they give up smoking as soon as possible. There are many programs that can help.
Tobacco has been shown to decrease the number and quality of sperm in male smokers. It can also hurt the antioxidant levels in semen. Antioxidants protect sperm from damage from free radicals, which can affect their motility and ability to fertilize an egg. If a couple is undergoing fertility treatment, poor results during in-vitro fertilization have also been reported when the male partner smokes.
There is clear evidence that using marijuana reduces male fertility, too. Marijuana can alter the endocrine system, which regulates reproductive hormones, and lower the man's levels of testosterone (the hormone responsible for sperm production). Marijuana is also toxic to human sperm, reducing motility and fertilization potential.
Marijuana and tobacco use should be avoided while trying to conceive.Editor's note: Learn how smoking during pregnancy affects you and your baby.

There is some research to support the idea that stress levels and depression might hurt a man's fertility. Many of the studies have been conducted on men undergoing infertility treatment, however, so experts can't always tell whether the stress is causing infertility or the infertility (and its treatments) is causing stress.
 
In addition, many people who are stressed engage in activities that might also contribute to infertility, such as smoking and alcohol use.
 
Still, at this point, it seems likely that psychological stress can lower sperm quality. A study of over 700 men published in the March 2010 issue of Fertility and Sterility concluded that stressful life events may be associated with decreased semen quality in fertile men.
 
And a review of over 50 studies of socio-psycho-behavioral factors published in the same journal in January 2011 concludes that psychological stress is a risk factor for lower semen quality. Other factors are higher age, smoking, and alcohol consumption.
 
Stress can affect energy level and libido as well. If your spouse is stressed out by a high-pressure job or overextended with outside commitments, he's less likely to have the energy to jump in the sack when you're ready to make a baby.
 
Finally, fertility problems can wreak havoc on an otherwise healthy relationship. If you're completely focused on baby-making, your partner may end up feeling more like a sperm donor. Try to keep in mind that sex can be fun and pleasurable, and it can bring the two of you closer together.
 
One way to lighten things up is to keep fun sex separate from baby-making sex. If you have the room, consider using the guest bed or sofa for procreating and your own bed for just-for-fun sex.

41	how to get pregnant	How to have a girl or boy: Does sex selection work?	https://www.babycenter.com/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/choosing-your-babys-sex-what-the-scientists-say_2915	"How to have a girl or boy: Does sex selection work?

Does sex selection work?
 
Yes, there are sex selection methods that work, but the success rates depend on the method you use. At one end is reliable, clinically proven high-tech fertility treatment (IVF with preimplantation genetic testing). At the other is folk wisdom (such as making love standing up and eating more meat if you want a boy, and eating lots of chocolate and having sex in the missionary position if you want a girl). In between are low-tech sex selection techniques, such as the Shettles and Whelan methods (see below).
 
Keep in mind that Mother Nature has already tipped the odds a bit in favor of boys: In the United States, there are approximately 1,047 boys born for every 1,000 girls.
 
Note: The terms gender and sex are often used interchangeably when talking about this topic. But sex and gender aren't the same thing. A child's sex is what's usually assigned to them at birth, based on biology – the chromosomes and genitals they were born with. A child's gender relates to cultural standards and expected characteristics of men and women. And gender identity is based on a person's concept of themselves – how they feel and how they wish to express those feelings. A person's gender may not match their assigned sex.
 
Why do parents choose sex selection?
 
Sex selection is an option for couples who want to:
  Avoid passing a sex-linked genetic disease to their baby. For example, some females are carriers for over 350 X-linked diseases, even if they aren't directly affected by the disease. Hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy are examples of diseases that occur with a recessive gene on the X (female) chromosome. Reduce the risk of their baby having a disease more common in certain sexes. For example, a family who has a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) might try for a girl because ASD has a higher male incidence, and their chances of having another affected boy is 26 percent. Choose the sex of their baby because of a personal preference. Sex selection might appeal to parents who have a child or children of one sex and want to have a child of the other sex, for example. (This is sometimes called ""family balancing."")  
What are the different types of sex selection techniques?
 
Beginning with the most accurate technique, here are methods of choosing your baby's sex:
 Fertility treatment: In vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) What it is
 
Infertility treatment is one way to try to choose your baby's sex. This safe and highly effective technique uses in vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) in tandem.
 
Here are the steps:

  Fertility drugs. IVF starts with a round of fertility drugs to stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple eggs for fertilization, instead of the single egg typically released each month. Egg retrieval. When your eggs are ready to be retrieved, a doctor gives you an anesthetic and inserts an ultrasound probe through your vagina to check your ovaries and follicles (the fluid-filled sacs where eggs mature). On top of the ultrasound probe is a thin needle that goes through the vaginal wall to remove the eggs from the follicles in the ovaries. Fertilization. After retrieval, your eggs are fertilized with sperm in a petri dish. (In vitro means occurring outside the organism. In this case, it means fertilization is taking place outside your body.) Examination/testing. Five days after fertilization, the resulting embryos are examined and tested. Three to five cells are removed from an embryo and tested thoroughly for genetic or chromosomal abnormalities and the sex chromosomes X and Y. This is called preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). Transfer. During your next cycle, your doctor will place the selected fertilized eggs – now embryos – in your uterus by inserting a thin tube through your vagina and cervix (the opening to the uterus). With IVF, the number of embryos transferred depends on your age, the quality of the embryos, and your reproductive history. But generally, if an embryo has been PGT tested, only one will be transferred because those that are unlikely to implant or unlikely to result in a healthy pregnancy have been weeded out.  
By the way, prenatal tests, such as cell-free DNA testing (noninvasive prenatal testing or NIPT),  amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS), are still offered during pregnancy to check for genetic abnormalities.
 
Most fertility clinics offer non-medical sex selection, but you'll want to confirm it with the clinic you have in mind. Also iron out the cost (financially and in time) and steps involved so you can make an educated decision about whether the process is worth it to you.
 
If you're serious about trying one of these techniques for family balancing, you'll have to meet strict requirements. At some fertility clinics, you won't be eligible unless you're married and already have at least one child of the opposite sex you're trying for. And some clinics have age limits, but all will run hormone tests to see if you're still fertile.
 Effectiveness
 
Preimplantation genetic testing is close to 100 percent accurate at determining the sex of the embryo. The IVF success rate depends on a number of factors, but for women younger than 35 using her own eggs, the success rate for becoming pregnant on the first try is almost 60 percent.
 Pros of IVF with PGT
  If you do get pregnant, PGT ensures with almost 100 percent accuracy that you'll have a baby of the sex you desire. Following a PGT cycle, remaining embryos of both sexes can be frozen. These can be used in the future if you miscarry or decide you want more children. Frozen embryos have a success rate similar to fresh transfers, but the procedure is less invasive and significantly cheaper. PGT allows higher success rates during IVF, especially for older women. The percentage of live births per egg retrieval starts to decline significantly after age 35. Most IVF centers report higher success rates with PGT, since abnormal embryos are excluded.  Cons of IVF with PGT
  A single round of IVF with preimplantation genetic testing can cost more than $20,000. (Check with your insurance – some expenses may be covered.) The procedure is invasive, and having eggs removed from your ovaries can be painful. Fertility drugs can have uncomfortable side effects, including weight gain, bloating, swelling, and blurred vision. IVF procedures must be timed correctly, which often means you'll need to be in close proximity to your doctor for the duration of treatment. 
 Ericsson method What it is
 
This technique, named for its founder Ronald Ericsson, aims to separate faster-swimming, boy-producing sperm from slower-swimming, girl-producing sperm. It's used in combination with artificial insemination (AI).
 Effectiveness
 
The technique claims to be 70 to 75 percent effective, with more favorable results for conceiving boys than girls. Some independent studies have supported these claims, while others have contested them. One study of over 2,000 embryos from women undergoing IVF showed no significant improvement in the likelihood of one desired gender over another using this method.
 How it's done
 
First, a sperm sample is poured on a gluey layer of fluid in a test tube. The fluid is liquid albumin, so the technique is sometimes referred to as albumin separation. All the sperm naturally swim down, but the boy-producing sperm tend to swim faster and reach the bottom sooner.
 
Once the fast and slow swimmers are separated, you're inseminated with the sperm that may help you conceive a baby of the sex you desire.
 Pros
  Inexpensive compared to higher-tech methods Noninvasive Relatively safe  Cons
  There's no guarantee of success. Ericsson has published his own research and claims a success rate of approximately 75 to 80 percent, but evaluations of the test haven't been published by other fertility experts or proven independently. AI is not as effective as IVF, and it may take many cycles to achieve a pregnancy, depending on your age and fertility.  Cost
 
Approximately $600 to $1,200 per attempt
 Availability
 
In the United States, this technique is only available through a handful of franchised clinics.

 MicroSort (Flow cytometry) 
Maybe you've heard of MicroSort, though it's not approved for use in the United States.
 What it is
 
This technique involves staining the sperm with a fluorescent dye and then separating the male and female sperm cells using a flow cytometer. Once the sperm are identified, the preferred sperm can be placed in the uterus during ovulation using AI or IVF.
 Effectiveness
 
In its initial clinical trial, MicroSort reported 90 percent effectiveness for female gender selection and 85 percent for male gender selection. But these numbers have not been conclusively confirmed independently.
 How it's done
 
The sperm sample is washed and then stained with a fluorescent dye that attaches to the DNA in the sperm. The stained cells are passed through a laser and examined to see which shine brighter. The female sperm cells, because they contain slightly more genetic material than male sperm cells, will give off more light. The sperm carrying the X (if female gender is desired) or Y (if male gender is desired) chromosome are separated. The sorting takes about six or seven hours.
 Pros 
  Can be used for AI or IVF or can be stored for future use using cryopreservation.  Cons
  This method is not available in the United States. There is some concern that techniques that modify sperm may affect sperm quality. Researchers continue to study this. To use MicroSort, couples must have at least one child and use the technique for the underrepresented gender or be a known carrier of a chromosomal-linked disorder.  Cost
 
MicroSort costs about $3,200 per try.
 Availability
 
MicroSort is not FDA-approved and is not available in the United States. It is still offered in Mexico, North Cyprus, Japan, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Nigeria.

 At-home gender selection techniques 
These low-tech methods are noninvasive and affordable, and you can do them in the privacy of your own home. All you need to do is chart your basal body temperature or use an ovulation calculator or ovulation test kit to determine when you ovulate, then time sex accordingly.
 
So what's the catch? They're not dependable. Still, it might be fun to try! Just keep in mind that the odds are 50/50 – don't be disappointed if your efforts don't work.
 Shettles method What it is
 
Timed intercourse on specific days of your cycle, using sexual position, depth of penetration, and female orgasm to enhance the probabilities.
 Effectiveness
 
Shettles proponents claim the technique is 75 percent effective for choosing girls and 80 percent for choosing boys, but other experts are doubtful. Keep in mind that you always have about a 50 percent chance of conceiving a girl and a 50 percent chance of conceiving a boy.
 How it's done
 
The theory is that sperm bearing a Y chromosome (for boys) move faster but don't live as long as sperm that carry X chromosomes (for girls). So, if you want a boy, the Shettles method contends you should have sex as close as possible to ovulation. If you want a girl, plan to have sex two to four days before you ovulate.
 Pros
  Does not require drugs or invasive medical procedures Free or low cost Safe  Cons
  You must chart your basal body temperature or otherwise calculate your ovulation to estimate the best time to have intercourse. There's no guarantee of success.  Availability
 
Anyone can try it at home.

 Whelan method What it is
 
Timed intercourse on specific days of your cycle.
 Effectiveness
 
Elizabeth Whelan claims her technique is 68 percent effective for choosing boys and 56 percent effective for choosing girls, but many experts are doubtful. Again, you always have a 50 percent chance of conceiving a child of the sex you want.
 How it's done
 
The Whelan method directly contradicts the Shettles method. The theory here is that the biochemical changes that may favor boy-producing sperm occur earlier in a woman's cycle.
 
So, if you want a boy, you should have intercourse four to six days before your basal body temperature goes up. If you want a girl, plan to have sex two to three days before you ovulate.
 Pros
  Does not require drugs or invasive medical procedures Free or low cost Safe  Cons
  You need to take your basal body temperature every day to figure out when you're ovulating, or use other methods to calculate when you ovulate. There's no guarantee of success  Availability
 
Anyone can try it at home.

 Gender selection kits What it is
 
These at-home kits are based on the Shettles theory. Separate girl and boy kits include a thermometer, ovulation predictor test sticks, vitamins, herbal extracts, and douches that are supposedly intended to favor a specific sex.
 Effectiveness
 
Kit makers claim a 96 percent success rate, but some medical experts say the manufacturer's claims have no scientific merit.
 How it's done
 
You track your cycle by using the thermometer and urinating on the ovulation predictor test sticks. Following the Shettles method, you have intercourse two to four days before ovulation if you want a girl and as close as possible to ovulation if you want a boy.
 
The douche is intended to change the vaginal environment to make it more conducive for either an X-carrying sperm or a Y-carrying sperm to fertilize the egg. Vitamins and herbal extracts are also included to supposedly boost your odds of getting a child that is the sex of your choice.
 Pros
  Does not require invasive medical procedures Convenient  Cons
  The success rate claimed by kit makers is questionable Douching is not recommended by doctors, and can actually lead to other problems like vaginal infections. Expensive  Cost
 
$199 for a 30-day kit.
 Availability
 
Sex-selection kits are available online.

Should I try sex selection?
 
This is a very personal choice based on your family's needs and desires. If you're eager to conceive but are concerned about a sex-linked genetic disease, for example, high-tech gender selection might be especially attractive to you. (Your healthcare provider and/or a genetic counselor can help you sort out the best path.)
 
If you're daydreaming about how nice it might be to have a girl – or a boy – this time around, perhaps you'll want to try less high-tech options. Or maybe you have your heart set on a boy or a girl for personal reasons and are willing to do whatever you can to make that happen.
 
High-tech sex-selection methods have stirred hot debate in the medical community. Some doctors think it's a great way to balance families, while others think we're heading down a dangerous path.
 
What is the opposition to sex selection?
 
Here are some of the concerns voiced by those who oppose sex selection:
  It may reinforce sex biases and sex ratio imbalances, especially in cultures where one sex is more highly valued. Even in the U.S., there is some evidence that the use of PGT shifts the sex ratio from about 105 boys per 100 girls to 110 boys per 100 girls. This may be in part because of increased selection of male embryos and in part because the procedure slightly favors male embryo survival. It has the potential to psychologically harm children – whether they were the desired sex or not. Children who are the desired sex may not behave in sex-specific ways expected by the parents, for example. Or the parents may be disappointed if the sex selection was unsuccessful. The destruction of excess embryos for the purpose of sex selection is unethical.  
In a statement titled, The use of reproductive technology for sex selection for nonmedical reasons, ASRM states that ""sex selection should not be encouraged for nonmedical indications."" It also states, ""The ASRM Ethics Committee recognizes that there are reasoned differences of opinion about the permissibility of these practices and does not have a consensus on the permissibility of these practices."" They go on to say that clinics are encouraged to develop their own policies and are under no ethical obligation to provide or refuse these services.
 
Low-tech sex selection has not sparked the same controversy, probably because these methods are far from foolproof, and the assumption is that couples practicing them are investing less – both financially and emotionally – in their success.

Can what you eat predict your baby's sex?
 
According to old wives' tales, yes. But scientifically, no.
 
Though the X and Y chromosomes in sperm ultimately determine whether you have a girl or boy, some myths say diet can influence a woman's body chemistry, making you more likely to conceive one or the other. Based on legend, a wide variety of foods can do the trick.
 If you want a boy...
  Eat more veggies. Opt for foods high in potassium, such as bananas and white beans. Stick with salty snacks such as pretzels and chips. Cut back on eggs and dairy products. Drink coffee before sex.  If you want a girl...
  Give in to your chocolate craving, or just eat sweets in general. Eat foods high in calcium and magnesium, such as fish, spinach, and yogurt. 
 
Sometimes, beliefs about diet contradict each other. For example, some people say that eating more meat raises your chances of having a boy, while others advise you to eat less meat to get the same result.
 
The truth, however, is there's no scientific proof food has any sway over your baby's sex. Even the limited research suggesting a link between the two can't prove cause and effect – just that there could be a relationship.
 
Can having sex around the moon phases influence whether you have a boy or girl?
 
It's true that the timing of intercourse does influence whether you can get pregnant, but it can't influence your baby's sex.

However, many of us still like to check our horoscope, so is it any surprise that superstition and folklore have led to theories about when to make love if you want to pick your baby's sex?
 
Word has it:
 If you want a boy...
  Sleep together when there's a quarter moon in the sky. Have sex at night. Mark your calendar – more boys are conceived on odd days of the month. Follow the compass – one BabyCenter parent swears that pointing the woman's head north while making love guarantees a boy.  If you want a girl...
  Hit the sheets when the moon is full. Make a date in the afternoon. Get together on the even days of the month.  
Another sex-selection myth is related to ovulation, or when your ovary releases an egg. The story goes that having sex close to your ovulation date means you're more likely to have a boy, since sperm containing a Y chromosome are faster swimmers – essentially, they'll get there first. For a girl, you're supposed to space the timing out a bit more.
 
So, what's the real deal? It's true that sleeping together during your “fertile window” – the five days before ovulation and the day you ovulate – can increase the chances of getting pregnant. But in general, the dates and times of intercourse have no influence over whether your baby is a boy or girl.
 
Can temperature affect your baby's sex?
 
It depends what you're talking about temperature-wise.
 
Some old wives' tales have to do with body temperature. For a daughter, they say a man's testicles are supposed to be cool before you have sex. For a son, it's best if they are warm. The idea plays into a common belief about boxers versus briefs: Wearing boxers keeps the area nice and breezy, meaning you're more likely to have a girl. Donning tighty-whities, on the other hand, generates heat, tipping the balance in favor of a boy.
 
The truth is, scrotal temperature doesn't affect the sex of a baby. It can, however, influence sperm production. Several studies have found that men who wear boxers have higher sperm counts and sperm concentration than those who wear other types of underwear. This could be because boxers keep the genitals cooler.
 
If you're talking about temperature in terms of the weather, it may be a different story. Some studies have found there are more girls born in higher-latitude areas, which generally have colder temperatures. (Think Sweden vs. Greece.) Other studies suggest that the season at the time of conception may play a role, too.
 
And then, there's climate change. According to a handful of analyses, natural catastrophes may mean more girls, while warmer days caused by global warming may tilt the odds slightly towards boys.
 
Other old wives' tales about conceiving a boy or girl
 
Quite a few folktales about sex selection revolve around the best way to make love.
 If you want a boy...
  Make love standing up. Try the rear-entry position. Have deeply penetrative sex. Focus on her pleasure – make sure the woman climaxes. The man is supposed to initiate sex.  If you want a girl...
  Give the missionary position a go. Try spooning! Make love with the woman on top. Focus on his pleasure – the man needs to orgasm but the woman isn't supposed to. Let the woman initiate sex. Try to remain relaxed during sex.  
And still more tales defy categorization. One says that if you want to conceive a boy, the woman can hold a nickel in her mouth during sex. Another story says that the baby's sex is determined by which partner is dominant in the relationship at the time of conception.
 
As with the other legends, there's no evidence sex is determined by relationship dynamics, sexual positions, or coins. The chances of giving birth to a boy or a girl are always about 50-50, unless you select the sex during in vitro fertilization.
